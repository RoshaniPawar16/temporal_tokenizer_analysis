_She carries a large piece of cheese in her mouth._] MADAM. O joy! O joy! Come, dear daughter, come! We'll dine as if we were queen and princess! [_Miss Crow flies to Madam Crow. Enter_ MASTER FOX.] FOX. I bid you good morning, dear madam. MADAM. Good morning to you, dear sir. FOX (_sitting under tree_). With your permission, I'll speak with your daughter. MADAM. She'll be pleased to listen, that she will--you are so clever. FOX (_modestly_). Nay, madam, not so clever, only thoughtful. [_He sighs deeply twice._] MADAM. You have something on your mind. FOX (_sighing_). Yes, dear madam,--I am thinking of your daughter. MADAM. Then speak! Speak now, sir!--at once, sir! FOX. I speak. O sweet Miss Crow, how beautiful your wings are! MADAM (_pleased_). Do you hear that, daughter? [_Miss Crow nods, spreading her wings proudly._] FOX. I speak again. How bright your eye, dear maid! How graceful your neck! MADAM. Bend your neck, child! Now bend it well that he may better see your grace. [_Miss Crow bends neck twice._] FOX. But oh, that such a sweet bird should be dumb!--should be so utterly dumb! [_He weeps gently in his little pocket handkerchief._] MADAM (_indignantly_). Do you think, sir, she cannot _caw_ as well as the rest of us? FOX. I must think so, dear madam. Alas! [_Weeping again in his little pocket handkerchief._] MADAM. You shall think so, then, no longer! Caw, child, caw, as you have never cawed before! MISS CROW (_opening mouth; dropping cheese_). Caw! Caw! [_Fox quickly snaps up the cheese._] FOX (_going_). Thank you, Miss Crow. Remember, dear madam, that whatever I said of her beauty, I said nothing of her brains. [_He goes, waving the crows a farewell with his little pocket handkerchief._] THE MILLER, HIS SON, AND THEIR DONKEY TIME: _this morning_. PLACE: _a bridge, near a town and not far from a Fair_. * * * * * THE MILLER AND HIS SON. FIRST MAID. SECOND MAID. THIRD MAID. FIRST OLD MAN. SECOND OLD MAN. THIRD OLD MAN. FIRST GOODY. SECOND GOODY. THIRD GOODY. THE MAYOR. HIS FIRST CLERK. HIS SECOND CLERK. * * * * * [_The_ MILLER _and his_ SON _are driving their donkey across the bridge. They go to the Fair._] SON. Do you expect to get a good price for our donkey, father? MILLER (_nodding_). Aye, lad; the Fair is the place to take your wares. SON. Our donkey is not so young, though. MILLER. Neither is he so old, though. SON. But he is not so fat, though. MILLER. Neither is he so lean, though. SON. Truly he might be worse. MILLER. Better or worse, he must be sold. [THREE MAIDS _enter the bridge. They go to the Fair._] FIRST MAID (_pointing to the Miller and his Son_). Look there! Did you ever see such geese? SECOND MAID. As I live!--walking when they might ride! THIRD MAID (_to the Miller_). You'll get a laugh at the Fair, old man! [_The Maids pass on._] MILLER. This may be true. Get you upon the beast, lad. [_The boy mounts the donkey. Enter_ THREE OLD MEN. _They talk together earnestly. They go to the Fair._] FIRST OLD MAN (_pointing to the Miller and his Son_). Look you there! That proves what I was saying. SECOND OLD MAN (_nodding_). Aye! There's no respect shown old age in these days. THIRD OLD MAN (_nodding_). Aye! There's that young rogue riding while his old father has to walk! [_The Old Men pass on._] MILLER. Get down, lad. 'T would indeed look better should I ride. [_The lad dismounts; the Miller mounts. Enter_ THREE GOODIES; _they go to the Fair._] FIRST GOODY (_indignantly, pointing to the Miller and his Son_). Look, Goodies, look! Did you ever see anything so cruel? SECOND GOODY (_to the Miller_). You lazy old fellow! How can you ride while your own child walks in the dust? THIRD GOODY (_to the lad_). You poor, poor child! [_The Goodies pass on, shaking their heads and their canes indignantly._] MILLER. Come, lad, get up behind me. SON. Why, father, I'm not tired! MILLER. I know, but we must try to please them. Come. [_The lad mounts, sitting behind his father. Enter the_ MAYOR _and his_ CLERKS. _They go to the Fair._] MAYOR (_turning to his Clerks; pointing to the Miller and his Son_). Look, will you! (_He turns to the Miller._) Pray, honest friend, is that beast your own? MILLER. Yes, my lord Mayor. MAYOR. One would not think so from the way you load him. Say you not so, my Clerks? FIRST CLERK (_bowing_). Just so, my lord Mayor. SECOND CLERK (_bowing_). Even so, my lord Mayor. THE MAYOR (_to the Miller and his Son_). Why, you two fellows are better able to carry the poor donkey than he you! Say you not so, my Clerks? FIRST CLERK (_bowing_). Just so, my lord Mayor. SECOND CLERK (_bowing_). Even so, my lord Mayor. MILLER. Come, my son, to please them, we'll carry the donkey. [_They dismount and try to lift the donkey. This frightens the poor beast. He tries to get away, and falls over the bridge into the deep river._] MILLER (_weeping_). I have tried to please every one! I have pleased no one! SON (_weeping_). And we have lost our donkey in the bargain! [Illustration: "WE HAVE LOST OUR DONKEY"] EACH IN HIS OWN PLACE TIME: _yesterday_. PLACE: _in a tiny house_. * * * * * THE STRAW _who brings in the wood_. THE COAL _who makes the fire_.
