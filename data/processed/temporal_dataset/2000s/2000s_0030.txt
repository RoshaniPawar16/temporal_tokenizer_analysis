It is understood, of course, that the plug associated with this jack has two contacts, referred to respectively as the tip and the sleeve; the tip makes contact with the tip spring _1_ and the sleeve with the sleeve or thimble _2_. [Illustration: Fig. 240. Normal Condition of Line] The drop or line signal is permanently connected between the jack sleeve and the anvil _3_. As a result, the drop is normally bridged across the circuit of the line so as to be in a receptive condition to signaling current sent out by the subscriber. It is evident, however, that when the plug is inserted into the jack this connection between the line and the drop will be broken. In this normal condition of the line, therefore, the drop stands ready at the central office to receive the signal from the subscriber and the generator at the sub-station stands ready to be bridged across the circuit of the line as soon as the subscriber turns its handle. Similarly the ringer--the call-receiving device at the sub-station--is permanently bridged across the line so as to be responsive to any signal that may be sent out from the central office in order to call the subscriber. The subscriber's talking apparatus is, in this normal condition of the line, cut out of the circuit by the switch hook. _Subscriber Calling._ Fig. 241 shows the condition of the line when the subscriber at the sub-station is making a call. In turning his generator the two springs which control the connection of the generator with the line are brought into engagement with each other so that the generator currents may pass out over the line. The condition at the central office is the same as that of Fig. 240 except that the drop is shown with its shutter fallen so as to indicate a call. [Illustration: Fig. 241. Subscriber Calling] [Illustration: A SPECIALLY FORMED CABLE FOR KEY SHELF OF MONARCH SWITCHBOARD] _Operator Answering._ The next step is for the operator to answer the call and this is shown in Fig. 242. The subscriber has released the handle of his generator and the generator has, therefore, been automatically cut out of the circuit. He also has removed his receiver from its hook, thus bringing his talking apparatus into the line circuit. The operator on the other hand has inserted one of the plugs _P__{a} into the jack. This action has resulted in the breaking of the circuit through the drop by the raising of the spring _1_ from the anvil _3_, and also in the continuance of the line circuit through the conductors of the cord circuits. Thus, the upper limb of the line is continued by means of the engagement of the tip spring _1_ with the tip _4_ of the plug to the conducting strand _6_ of the cord circuit; likewise the lower limb of the line is continued by the engagement of the thimble _2_ of the jack with the sleeve contact _5_ of the plug _P__{a} to the strand _7_ of the cord circuit. The operator has also closed her listening key _L.K._ In doing so she has brought the springs _8_ and _9_ into engagement with the anvils _10_ and _11_ and has thus bridged her head telephone receiver with the secondary of her induction coil across the two strands _6_ and _7_ of the cord. Associated with the secondary winding of her receiver is a primary circuit containing a transmitter, battery, and the primary of the induction coil. It will be seen that the conditions are now such as to permit the subscriber at the calling station to converse with the operator and this conversation consists in the familiar "Number Please" on the part of the operator and the response of the subscriber giving the number of the line that is desired. Neither the plug _P__{c}, nor the ringing key _R.K._, shown in Fig. 242, is used in this operation. The clearing-out drop _C.O._ is bridged permanently across the strands _6-7_ of the cord, but is without function at this time; the fact that it is wound to a high resistance and impedance prevents its having a harmful effect on the transmission. [Illustration: Fig. 242. Operator Answering] It may be stated at this point that the two plugs of an associated pair are commonly referred to as the answering and calling plugs. The answering plug is the one which the operator always uses in answering a call as just described in connection with Fig. 242. The calling plug is the one which she next uses in connecting with the line of the called subscriber. It lies idle during the answering of a call and is only brought into play after the order of the calling subscriber has been given, in which case it is used in establishing connection with the called subscriber. [Illustration: Fig. 243. Operator Calling] _Operator Calling._ We may now consider how the operator calls the called subscriber. The condition existing for this operation is shown in Fig. 243. The operator after receiving the order from the calling subscriber inserts the calling plug _P__{c} into the jack of the line of the called station.
