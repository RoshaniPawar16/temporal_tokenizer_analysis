We shall write much together, urging our views on this subject of Marriage. We shall have to be poor, I expect, but we shall be content. GERTRUDE. Content! AGNES. Quite content. Don't judge us by my one piece of cowardly folly in keeping the truth from you, Mrs. Thorpe, Indeed, it's our great plan to live the life we have mapped out for ourselves, fearlessly, openly; faithful to each other, helpful to each other, so long as we remain together. GERTRUDE. But tell me--you don't know how I--how I have liked you!-- tell me, if Mr. Cleeve's wife divorces him, he will marry you? AGNES. No. GERTRUDE. No! AGNES. No. I haven't made you quite understand--Lucas and I don't desire to marry, in your sense. GERTRUDE. But you are devoted to each other! AGNES. Thoroughly. GERTRUDE. What, is that the meaning of "for as long as you are together?" You would go your different ways if ever you found that one of you was making the other unhappy? AGNES. I do mean that. We remain together only to help, to heal, to console. Why should men and women be so eager to grant to each other the power of wasting life? That is what marriage gives--the right to destroy years and years of life. And the right, once given, it attracts --attracts! We have both suffered from it. So many rich years out of my life have been squandered by it. And out of his life, so much force, energy--spent in battling with the shrew, the termagant he has now fled from; strength never to be replenished, never to be repaid--all wasted, wasted! GERTRUDE. Your legal marriage with him might not bring further miseries. AGNES. Too late! We have done with marriage; we distrust it. We are not now among those who regard marriage as indispensable to union. We have done with it! GERTRUDE. [Advancing to her.] You know that it would be impossible for me, if I would do so, to deceive my brother as to all this. AGNES. Why, of course, dear. GERTRUDE. [Looking at her watch.] Amos must be wondering-- AGNES. Run away, then. [GERTRUDE crosses quickly to the door.] GERTRUDE [Retracing a step or two.] Shall I see you--? Oh! AGNES. [Shaking her head.] Ah! GERTRUDE. [Going to her, constrainedly.] When Amos and I have talked this over, perhaps--perhaps-- AGNES. No, I fear not. Come, my dear friend--[with a smile]--give me a shake of the hand. GERTRUDE. [Taking her hand.] What you've told me is dreadful. [Looking into AGNES' face.] And yet you're not a wicked woman! [Kissing AGNES.] In case we don't meet again. [The women separate quickly, looking towards the door, as LUCAS enters.] LUCAS. [Shaking hands with GERTRUDE.] How do you do, Mrs Thorpe? I've just had a wave of the hand from your brother. GERTRUDE. Where is he? LUCAS. On his back in a gondola, a pipe in his mouth as usual, gazing skywards. [Going on to the balcony.] He's within hail. [GERTRUDE goes quickly to the door, followed by AGNES.] There! By the Palazzo Sforza. [He re-enters the room; GERTRUDE has disappeared. He is going towards the door.] Let me get hold of him, Mrs. Thorpe. AGNES. [Standing before LUCAS, quietly] She knows, Lucas, dear. LUCAS. Does she? AGNES. She overheard some gossip at the Caffe Quadri yesterday, and began questioning me; so I told her. LUCAS. [Taking off his coat.] Adieu to them, then--eh? AGNES. [Assisting him.] Adieu. LUCAS. I intended to write to the brother directly they had left Venice, to explain. AGNES. Your describing me as "Mrs. Cleeve" at the hotel in Florence helped to lead us into this; after we move from here I must always be, frankly, "Mrs. Ebbsmith." LUCAS. These were decent people. You and she had formed quite an attachment? AGNES. Yes. [She places his coat, &c. on a chair, then fetches her work-basket from the cabinet.] LUCAS. There's something of the man in your nature, Agnes. AGNES. I've anathematised my womanhood often enough. [She sits at the table, taking out her work composedly.] LUCAS. Not that every man possesses the power you have acquired--the power of going through life with compressed lips. AGNES. [Looking up, smiling.] A propos? LUCAS. These people--this woman you've been so fond of. You see them shrink away with the utmost composure. AGNES. [Threading a needle.] You forget, dear, that you and I have prepared ourselves for a good deal of this sort of thing. LUCAS. Certainly, but at the moment-- AGNES. One must take care that the regret lasts no longer than a moment. Have you seen your uncle? LUCAS. A glimpse. He hadn't long risen. AGNES. He adds sluggishness to other vices, then? LUCAS. [Lighting a cigarette.] He greeted me through six inches of open door. His toilet has its mysteries. AGNES. A stormy interview? LUCAS. The reverse. He grasped my hand warmly, declared I looked the picture of health, and said it was evident I had been most admirably nursed. AGNES. [Frowning.] That's a strange utterance. But he's an eccentric, isn't he? LUCAS. No man has ever been quite satisfied as to whether his oddities are ingrained or affected. AGNES. No man. What about women? LUCAS. Ho! They have had opportunities of closer observation. AGNES. Hah! And they report--? LUCAS. Nothing. They become curiously reticent. AGNES.
