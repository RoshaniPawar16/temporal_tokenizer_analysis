It is calculated that a boat twelve feet in diameter would carry about fifty passengers, and that it could be carried on deck or hung over the stern on davits, in either of which positions it might be used as a cabin during the voyage; and further, if hung on a universal point like a compass, it would retain its equilibrium no matter what the motion of the ship might be, thus affording a safe retreat for persons subject to sea-sickness. AWA’. LINES WRITTEN ON THE DEATH OF JEANIE, A FAVOURITE CHILD, AGED SEVEN YEARS. Thou ’rt lyin’ cauld an’ still, my bonnie bonnie; The dews o’ death lie heavy on thy broo; Thy sunny smile nae mair will thrill this bosom; Thy sweet blue een are dark an’ sichtless noo! Hushed is thy fairy tread, my bonnie bonnie; Thy lips sae rosy red, I’ll kiss nae mair. O heavy thocht, that dims this ee wi’ sadness! O heart that fain wad break, wi’ anguish sair! I cry thy name in vain, my bonnie bonnie; For aye thy form, thy dear-loved form I see; O face sae fair! O locks o’ golden splendour! O guileless heart, that fondly throbbed for me! A dreary blank is mine, my bonnie bonnie; Nae mair thy merry voice will cheer my ha’; An eerie stillness fills the darksome dwelling, Since thou, my sweetest flower, wert ta’en awa’! The angels cam’ for thee, my bonnie bonnie, As saftly flickered oot life’s feeble flame: The tender Shepherd took thee to His bosom, An’ left me wi’ a lanely, lanely hame! But oh! thou ’rt wi’ the blest, my bonnie bonnie, Where pain will rend thy gentle breist nae mair; Oh, when this weary heart lays doun its sorrow, My ain wee lassie, may I meet thee there!
