As it is a problem somewhat curious, tho’ not difficult, and its solution not generally known (having seen four different solutions, one of them very imperfect, extracted from the private books of an office in one of the departments of engineering in a neighbouring nation), I thought it might give some entertainment to the curious in these matters, if the whole process were published. In the following investigation, much the same with Mr. Jones’s, as the demonstrations of the principles therein used appeared to be wanting, they are here attempted to be supplied. PRINCIPLES. I. _A heavy body, that in the first second of time has fallen the height of a feet, has acquired such a velocity, that, moving uniformly therewith, will in the next second of time move the length of 2 a feet._ II. _The spaces run thro’ by falling bodies are proportional to one another as the squares of their last or acquired velocities._ These two principles are demonstrated by the writers on mechanics. III. _Water forced out of a larger chanel thro’ one or more smaller passages, will have the streams thro’ those passages contracted in the ratio of 25 to 21._ This is shewn in the 36th prop. of the 2d book of Newton’s Principia. IV. _In any stream of water, the velocity is such, as would be acquired by the fall of a body from a height above the surface of that stream._ This is evident from the nature of motion. V. _The velocities of water thro’ different passages of the same height, are reciprocally proportional to their breadths._ For, at some time, the water must be delivered as fast as it comes; otherwise the bounds would be overflowed. At that time, the same quantity, which in any time flows thro’ a section in the open chanel, is delivered in equal time thro’ the narrower passages; or the momentum in the narrow passages must be equal to the momentum in the open chanel; or the rectangle under the section of the narrow passages, by their mean velocity, must be equal to the rectangle under the section of the open chanel by its mean velocity. Therefore the velocity in the open chanel is to the velocity in the narrower passages, as the section of those passages is to the section of the open chanel. But the heights in both sections being equal, the sections are directly as the breadths; Consequently the velocities are reciprocally as the breadths. VI. _In a running stream, the water above any obstacles put therein will rise to such a height, that by its fall the stream may be discharged as fast as it comes._ For the same body of water, which flowed in the open chanel, must pass thro’ the passages made by the obstacles: And the narrower the passages, the swifter will be the velocity of the water: But the swifter the velocity of the water, the greater is the height, from whence it has descended: Consequently the obstacles, which contract the chanel, cause the water to rise against them. But the rise will cease, when the water can run off as fast as it comes: And this must happen, when, by the fall between the obstacles, the water will acquire a velocity in a reciprocal proportion to that in the open chanel as the breadth of the open chanel is to the breadth of the narrow passages. VII. _The quantity of the fall caused by an obstacle in a running stream is measured by the difference between the heights fallen from to acquire the velocities in the narrow passages and open chanel._ For just above the fall, the velocity of the stream is such, as would be acquired by a body falling from a height higher than the surface of the water: And at the fall, the velocity of the stream is such, as would be acquired by the fall of a body from a height more elevated than the top of the falling stream; and consequently the real fall is less than this height. Now as the stream comes to the fall with a velocity belonging to a fall above its surface; Consequently the height belonging to the velocity at the fall must be diminished by the height belonging to the velocity, with which the stream arrives at the fall. PROBLEM. _In a chanel of running water, whose breadth is contracted by one or more obstacles; the breadth of the chanel, the mean velocity of the whole stream, and the breadth of the water-way between the obstacles being given; To find the quantity of the fall occasioned by those obstacles._ Let _b_ = breadth of the chanel in feet. _v_ = mean velocity of the water in feet per sec. _c_ = breadth of the water-way between the obstacles. Now 25: 21∷ _c_: 21 ⁄ 25 _c_ the water-way contracted. _Principle III._ And 21 ⁄ 25 _c_: _b_∷ _v_: 25_b_ ⁄ 21_c_ _v_ the veloc. _per_ sec. in the water-way between the obstacles. _Princip. V._ Also (2_a_)²: _vv_∷ _a_: _vv_ ⁄ 4_a_ the height fallen to acquire the vel. v. I. & II. And (2_a_)²: (25_b_ ⁄ 21_c_)² × _vv_∷ _a_: (25_b_ ⁄ 21_c_)² × _vv_ ⁄ 4_a_ the height fallen to acquire the vel. 25_b_ ⁄ 21_c_ _v_. I. & II. Then (25_b_ ⁄ 21_c_)² x (_vv_ ⁄ 4_a_) - (_vv_ ⁄ 4_a_) is the measure of the fall required. VII.
