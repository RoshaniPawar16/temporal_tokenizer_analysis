Still James succeeded, because he had a purpose in his heart,—he did not think about it,—he did not speak about his purpose, but _he did it_! Which of these three boys was likest Daniel? Which of these boys is likest to you? _A purpose in the heart_ is like a spring of water; you may stem it up at one spot, but it will burst out at another,—_it will be done_! Let the purpose of your heart be that you will not sin, and you will be great and good too. [Illustration]
