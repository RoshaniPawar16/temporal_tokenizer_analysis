[129] Some correlation appears to exist between the mentality of an era and the average length of sentence in use. The seventeenth century, the most introspective, philosophical, and “revolutionary” era of English history, wrote the longest sentence in English literature. The next era, broadly recognized as the eighteenth century, swung in the opposite direction, with a shorter and much more modelled or contrived sentence. The nineteenth century, again turned a little solemn and introspective, wrote a somewhat long and loose one. Now comes the twentieth century, with its journalism and its syncopated tempo, to write the shortest sentence of all. [130] _The Prose Works of John Milton_, ed. J. A.

Although it is not our concern here, it probably could be shown that the essential requirements of oratory themselves depend upon a certain organization of society, such as an aristocratic republicanism. When Burke declares that a true natural aristocracy “is formed out of a class of legitimate presumptions, which, taken as generalities, must be admitted for actual truths” (_Works_ [London, 1853-64], III, 85-86) my impression is that he has in mind something resembling our “uncontested term.” The “legitimate presumptions” are the settled things which afford the plane of maneuver.

[152] There is commentary in the fact that the long commemorative address, with its assembled memories, was a distinctive institution of nineteenth-century America. Generalizations and “distance” were on such occasions the main resources.

The former are parts of the general mosaic of belief; the latter are uncritical aspirations, or at the worst, shibboleths. [155] _E.g._, Samuel T.
