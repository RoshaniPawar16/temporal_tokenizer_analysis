He groans, and the GUNNER laughs loudly._) THE GUNNER (_laughing_) It’s only bolted to the deck! Heave her up, cully! BIMBO (_still preoccupied with his writing_) We keep the seas longer than you of the merchant ships, mate. We can’t let much lie about loose. Don’t brain us with the chair; sit in it. (_He glances across at them authoritatively._) You in that one, madam. (_He points to another chair near ROBERT’S. They stare at him; he stares back, and after a moment they obey him. BIMBO looks at ROBERT._) I suppose you’re in a puzzle what we’ll do with you, mate. ROBERT I’ve faced death before this. BIMBO (_throwing down his pen impatiently_) You expect to have your throat cut, do you? ROBERT (_swallowing_) When you give the word for it. What else? BIMBO (_to the GUNNER, angrily_) You hear him? THE GUNNER (_gloomily_) Aye! It’s the way of our calling! BIMBO (_disgustedly_) It’s sickening! (_He gets up and paces the floor angrily for a moment or two, then turns sharply to ROBERT._) You think that’s all we want of a man like you--a man that fought a hundred of us when not another of your whole ship’s company lifted a cutlass! You think all we want of you is to slit your guzzlet, do you? Aye! You do! From the look of your fool face I see it. Sickening! ROBERT (_huskily_) Then what do you want? To hang me instead of cutting my throat? BIMBO Faugh! (_He turns back to the table and throws himself in his chair. The two captives watch him, terrorized, and as at some resentful thought he strikes the table with his clenched fist, LYDIA utters a little cry. He stares at her fiercely._) What, mistress? LYDIA Nothing. (_Shivers._) BIMBO (_gruffly to the GUNNER_) Send us Brimstone with fire. LYDIA (_crying out at this faintly_) Ah! (_The GUNNER goes out promptly._) BIMBO What? LYDIA (_weakly_) Brimstone and fire! For--what? BIMBO For you. ROBERT For her? BIMBO Who else? D’ye think I want ’em for me? For you, mistress! (_He begins to apply himself to the ledger._) LYDIA (_appealingly_) Robert! (_She rises, and so does ROBERT._) ROBERT (_hoarsely_) Lydia! (_She clings to him._) BIMBO (_standing up angrily_) Stand away from that woman! LYDIA Robert---- BIMBO (_roaring_) Stand away from her! (_He overawes them, and slowly their arms fall from each other. Staring miserably at him all the while, they resume their seats._) BIMBO (_grunting_) That’s better! (_He returns to his seat and the ledger. The door opens and LYDIA and ROBERT turn apprehensively as another pirate enters. He is dressed much as is the GUNNER, but is gaunt and of an extreme and unnatural pallor, his eyes glistening dishearteningly from dark hollows. He carries a pan of smoking hot embers._) LYDIA (_horrified_) Robert! (_ROBERT half rises._) BIMBO (_fiercely_) Sit where you are! (_ROBERT sinks into his seat. BIMBO explains._) It’s Brimstone and hot coals that I sent for. LYDIA (_appealing to the man with the coals_) Don’t hurt me! Don’t hurt me! Don’t---- BIMBO He’s deaf and dumb, mistress. LYDIA (_choking_) Oh! (_The DEAF-AND-DUMB MAN makes an unpleasant vocal sound, looking at BIMBO, who points to the brazier. The man dumps his coals in the brazier and stands beside it. The brazier glows. LYDIA and ROBERT stare at it in anguish. The DEAF-AND-DUMB MAN looks at BIMBO inquiringly, and the latter waves his hand. The DEAF-AND-DUMB MAN retires to a position near the door. LYDIA, panting, sinks down in her chair._) ROBERT (_hoarsely_) I have my hands free. They shan’t touch you, sweetheart! BIMBO (_angrily_) Stop that! ROBERT I will speak to her! BIMBO (_sharply_) Speak to her? Yes. But don’t you call her sweetheart. ROBERT (_defiantly, yet with a tender accent_) She is my sweetheart. BIMBO That may be; but don’t you call her so to-day, or I’ll have ’em truss you down again. (_He again applies himself to his ledger. LYDIA again looks at the brazier, shudders, and begins to weep spasmodically._) LYDIA (_brokenly_) Was it only a little while ago--when the moon rose--and you and I were happy, Robert? ROBERT I think--I think life is just a moon path on the sea. It looks all shining white and beautiful--but of a sudden a shark’s fin glides across it. We were swimmers in that moon path, sweet---- BIMBO (_interrupting fiercely_) Don’t you call her sweetheart! ROBERT (_defiantly_) Now, look ye, I won’t be told---- BIMBO You were going to! You would have if I hadn’t stopped you! Now I’ve warned you twice, and you take care! (_He claps his hands and the GUNNER appears in the doorway._) Fetch me in that old merchantlike critter with the fat paunch. (_The GUNNER withdraws._) LYDIA You want my father to see it, too, when you---- (_She looks at the glowing brazier and shudders._) BIMBO (_crisply_) The fat old merchantlike body is your father, is he? LYDIA (_weeping_) Yes--my father. BIMBO (_thoughtfully_) And you and he the only passengers aboard. (_To ROBERT._) The old man says he owns shares in your ship and cargo. ROBERT (_sullenly_) Yes, and in other ships and cargoes. ’Tis Mr.
