The joyous burst, and determined velocity of every hound, followed by upwards of a hundred horsemen, all in action at a single view; the spot embellished, or rather variegated, with carriages containing ladies, who come to enjoy the ceremony of _turning out_; and the emulative exertions of HORSES, HOUNDS, and MEN; afford a blaze of sporting brilliancy beyond the power of the utmost mental fertility to describe. At this moment of rapturous exultation only it is, that the kind of horse indispensibly necessary for this particular chase can be ascertained; for out of a hundred and twenty, thirty, forty, or a hundred and fifty horsemen, _seven_ or _eight_ only shall lay any where near, or within a hundred yards of the hounds; for the longer the burst, the more the slow-going horses _tail_; so that when the hounds are _stopt_ upon the heath, or in an open country, by the few who _are up_, lines of horsemen are seen behind, more than a mile in length, getting forward in a variety of directions, bearing no inapplicable affinity to various teams of _wild ducks_ crossing from one country to another. These horses, to whom it is all labour, are so distrest even with the _first burst_, that if the hounds break away, and the deer crosses the country, they are seldom to be seen at the end of a _second_. This is a most palpable and incontrovertible demonstration, that _any_ horse may _follow_, but none, except THOROUGHBRED horses, can go _with_ the hounds. During the time the chase is suspended, and the hounds are at bay, (which is till the King gets up,) the exhilarating sound of the horns before them, and the clamorous impatience of the hounds to proceed, constitute a scene so truly rich and ecstatic, that the tear of excessive joy and grateful sensibility may be frequently observed in almost every eye. After this relief of a few minutes to both HOUNDS and HORSES, in which they collect their _wind_, and become proportionally refreshed, the hounds are permitted to break away, which they do with a redoubled ardour, as if it had absolutely increased by their recent restraint. The same scene of racing and _tailing_ continues during every _burst_ to the termination of the chase, the longer which is, the more the field of horsemen become reduced; while the blood horses only move in perfect unison, and, at their common rating stroke, lay with _ease_ by the _side_ of the HOUNDS; and this is the reason why, in _long_ runs, so many are completely _thrown out_, and left to explore their way in different parts of the country through which the chase has passed. One material difference is known to exist between this kind of sport and every other; the utmost fortitude and indefatigable exertions are _here_ made to _save_: in all the rest, the summit of happiness, the sole gratification of local ambition, is to _kill_: so that, at any rate, STAG-HUNTING has the plea of HUMANITY in its favor; in proof of which, the hounds are never known to run from _chase_ to _view_, but every individual is feelingly alive to the _danger_ of the DEER, who have so largely and laboriously contributed to the completion of his own most ardent happiness: a secret inspiration operates upon every latent spring of human sensibility; and no difficulty at the moment seems too great to surmount, for the preservation of a life in which every spectator feels himself most impressively concerned. This final burst of a chase is most dreadfully severe, particularly if the last mile or two is _run in view_; when which is the case, the deer exerts all his utmost and remaining power to take the _soil_, if water is within his reach: this he sometimes does with the hounds so close to his haunches, that it is impossible to prevent their plunging with him into the stream. In such predicament, if it is found impracticable to draw off the body of the hounds, to insure his safety, the YEOMAN PRICKERS, and _others_, are frequently seen above their middles in water, (uncertain of its depth,) to preserve the life of the DEER, at the hazard of their own. This may be considered, by the recluse and callous Cynic, a degree of valour beyond discretion; but the debt of humanity, like the Hibernian Major's _word_ in the Comedy, is "a DEBT of HONOUR, and must be _paid_." The most moderate chases with the stag extend from an hour and a half to two hours; though from three to four hours is by no means uncommon in the course of the season.
