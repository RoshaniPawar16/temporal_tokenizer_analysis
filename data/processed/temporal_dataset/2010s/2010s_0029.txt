TWO GIRLS with riding hats and whips ENTER front right wing._ _NORA LEE is dainty with light hair and a rather sunburnt face and neck. She has pale lashes; she is petite and pretty and rather self-assured. She advances laughing._) NORA. Here we are! GORDON. (_Springing up and limping hurriedly to meet her, taking off his hat._) Oh, Nora, I’m glad you’ve come. NORA. Where is Robert? GORDON. Out with the men. He’ll be back by tea-time. (_LOVEDAY stands a little back looking round and waiting. She is taller than NORA; a splendidly built, dark-haired and beautiful woman, with a clear skin, deep searching eyes, regular features. She walks like a Queen and has a deep-toned, but soft and thrilling voice. She is all in white._) NORA. This is my cousin, Loveday Lewisham, Gordon. (_LOVEDAY smiles, comes forward and shakes hands with GORDON._) You know I told you all about her, and how she broke down with war-work in England and is going to make her home with us for six months. _You_ know. GORDON. I do know. (_Smiles._) I wish you welcome, Miss Lewisham. NORA. Loveday. GORDON. Yes. This is a friendly country. My name is Gordon. LOVEDAY. How beautiful that view is. And _what_ a ride we had. Three hours of fairyland! NORA. Oh, that’s nothing! Let us show her everything. Where’s old Roto? She wants to see a Maori. And where is Robert? GORDON. I’ll coo-ee for Robert. (_His coo-ee is long and penetrating so that it re-echoes._) And there is Roto. Hi. Come along, Roto. Miss Nora wants to show you off. (_ROTO advances from shelter, which is now in better order, the blankets piled up, etc._) ROTO. (_Grinning._) Here, Miss Nora. NORA. Good-day, Roto. See, Loveday. This is a real live Maori. Nothing wonderful after all! LOVEDAY. Oh, how do you do? ROTO. Finely, Miss. LOVEDAY. (_Smiling winningly._) You are not nearly so terrifying as I expected! ROTO. (_Grinning, pleased._) Maoris not allowed to be terrible now, Miss. LOVEDAY. That _is_ a shame. I’d so _much_ rather be a savage myself. What do you do now they won’t let you be a savage any more? ROTO. Help with the sheep and cook. LOVEDAY. (_Stooping forward and taking hold of ROTO’S green jade charm hanging on its long string round his neck._) And what is that queer thing you wear round your neck? NORA. (_Hastily._) A jade charm--these natives often wear them. They are very superstitious. GORDON. The Maoris believe in all sorts of charms and magic and spirits. They have a legend about these forests, for instance, that a goddess of wisdom lives in these hill tops and is a tree by day and a white woman at night. LOVEDAY. (_Her eyes sparkling_). Have you seen her? GORDON. Not yet--but sometimes-- LOVEDAY. But sometimes--go on--do tell me-- GORDON. Sometimes after a day alone in these forests, at sunset, when the heavens seem opening, one half imagines Wisdom is just behind one, slipping between the trees--I (_hesitates_). LOVEDAY. What an enchanting country. Tell me-- (_Sounds of arrival disturb them. ROBERT HYDE ENTERS. He is like GORDON, but much sturdier. He is very strong and manly, with a more sensual and less spiritual face. A very good fellow._) NORA. Here’s Robert. Robert! I have brought Loveday. This is Loveday Lewisham. She arrived last week, when you were out here. She would come so as to see a camp before you break it up. She wants to see _everything_. (_ROBERT and LOVEDAY shake hands. ROBERT is evidently much impressed._) ROBERT. I’ll show her. (_Goes over towards fire, and points to sheep enclosures at back._) Do you see those? That’s just the beginning of them. We have a rare good lot of sheep this year. LOVEDAY. I _am_ glad. We need everything good we can get this year. ROBERT. We need everything we can get every year. LOVEDAY. But this year specially. There are so many people in England who need extra feeding and clothing. Your sheep will be useful. ROBERT. I hadn’t thought of that. GORDON. Wool and mutton! Both necessaries. Of course we’ve all thought of that, Robert. NORA. Loveday is simply obsessed with the idea of the war, and says we ought not to have any luxuries. 2ND SHEP. Aye. She’s right. LOVEDAY. What is that sheep doing? (_Goes toward the lame sheep by the fire._) ROBERT. I dunno. Sick, I expect. Here, Roto. What is that sheep here for? ROTO. Leg broke, Boss. LOVEDAY. Oh, isn’t it thirsty? Look how its tongue hangs out. Let me give it some water. ROBERT. (_Smiling._) It doesn’t want water. LOVEDAY. Are sheep like rabbits? Don’t they need water? ROTO. (_Laughing._) Rabbits! ROBERT. (_Smiling._) Don’t you speak of rabbits to a New Zealander! Rabbits are the very devil here! We poison ’em, we shoot ’em, we trap ’em, we set dogs on ’em, we set stoats on to ’em, we imported weasels to catch ’em, we sent to Europe for ferrets to hike ’em out, we breed cats to catch ’em, we wire ’em in, and burn ’em out, and set poisoned corn over their runs, and kill ’em by thousands--but millions of ’em spring up out of the very earth and sometimes threaten to starve out the sheep, they clear the grass out. Rabbits! For the Lord’s sake don’t speak affectionately of rabbits. LOVEDAY.
