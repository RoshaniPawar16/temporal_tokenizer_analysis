The name _Hano_ or _Hanoki_ is, I believe, simply a combination of the words _Hano_ and _ki_, "eastern pueblo." The element _hano_ appears also in the designation for American, _Pahano_, "eastern water"; _pahanoki_, "American house." Both the Asa and the Tewa peoples are called _Hanum_ clans. [7] Remains of old reservoirs, elaborately walled, from which water was drawn by means of a gourd tied to a long pole, are still pointed out near Tukinovi and are said to have belonged to the _Pe-towa_. Old Tcasra claims that they were in use in his mother's grandmother's time. [8] The troubles following the great rebellion of 1680 drove many Tewa from the Rio Grande valley to Tusayan. [9] It is impossible to make this enumeration accurate, hence these numbers must be regarded as approximations. [10] It is not unusual to find several names applied to the same person. Thus, Hani, the chief of the _Piba_ clans at Walpi, is called Lesma in the Snake kiva. The Walpi call the author Nakwipi, but the Flute chief at Cipaulovi insists that his name is Yoyowaiamû, which appellation was given when the author was inducted into the Flute rites at that pueblo in 1891. [11] The gap in the East Mesa just at the head of the trail before one enters Hano. The pueblo of Walpi derived its name from this gap. [12] Their nomadic enemies raided so near the pueblo of the East Mesa that the priests were unable to visit their shrines without danger. The idol of _Talatumsi_, used in the New-fire ceremony, was removed from its shrine north of Wala on that account. [13] Later, as the outcome of a petty quarrel near the middle of the eighteenth century, the _Asa_ women moved to Sitcomovi which they founded. At present there is only one woman of this clan in Walpi, and no women of the _Honani_, both of which clans are strong in Sitcomovi. [14] Ten Broeck in 1852 seems to have been the first writer to adopt the true name, Hano, of the Tewa pueblo on the East Mesa. [15] One of the differences in custom between Hopi and Tewa women is the method of making their coiffures. Unmarried girls of Walpi and Hano dress their hair in the same manner, with whorls above the ears. Married women have different ways of wearing their hair in the two pueblos. During the wedding ceremonies at Hano the mother of the bride, in the presence of guests, combs her daughter's hair, or that part of it on the front of the scalp, over the face, so that it hangs down like a veil. She ties the hair on the back of the head in two coils, one of which hangs on either side, but the hair before the face she cuts on a level with the chin, beginning at the top of the ears. The hair which remains is too short to be done up in coils, and is simply brushed to one side or the other. Among Hopi married women all the hair is included in the two coils, and the "bang" is absent. [16] The names of many Tewa women end in _pobi_, corresponding with the Hopi _si_, a contracted form of _sihû_, in women's names, as Hoñsi, Nasiumsi, etc. [17] Among the Hopi the moon (Tewa _p'o_) is called _müiyaûh_; new moon, _müiyakatci_; first quarter, _müiyachaunacapti_; full moon, _müiyanacapti_. An eclipse of the moon is spoken of as _müiyaûh moki_, "dead moon." There was a total eclipse of the moon visible at Walpi near the end of December, 1898, when the full moon arose partially obscured. This, said Sikyatala, was bad for the Americans who dwell in the far east, but not for the Hopi. A "dead moon," when in the meridian of the Hopi pueblos, is considered _kalolamai_, "bad." [18] _The Winter Solstice Ceremony at Walpi_, op. cit. [19] The _Asa_ people are also called the _Tcakwaina_ clans. The ruins of their old village, near the western point of Awatobi mesa, are called Tcakwaina-ki. Its walls do not appear above the surface. [20] The particular ceremony of the _Pakab_ peoples is the _Momtcita_, a single day's rite which occurs just after the _Soyaluña_, under direction of Pautiwa. Connected with this ceremony are the performances of the "stick swallowers" or _Nocoto_ priests who were thought to be extinct at Walpi, but Eewa is chief of the _Nocotana_ priests, and the society includes Wikyatiwa, Talahoya, Sikyaventima, and others. They still practice stick-swallowing. Pautiwa is chief of the _Kalektaka_, a warrior priesthood. He belongs to the Eagle clan of the _Pakab_ phratry, which may be related to the _Awata_ or Bow clan of the former pueblo of Awatobi. [21] Tcoshoniwa is generally called by a nickname, Tcino, "Bald-head," or "Curly-hair," a sobriquet to which he strongly objects. He is one of the oldest men of Sitcomovi, belongs to the _Patki_ clan, and was formerly the _kimoñwi_ or governor of Sitcomovi. Hani, of the _Piba_ (Tobacco) clan, is political chief of Walpi; and Anote, also of the _Piba_ clan, is chief of Hano. All the pueblos have _kimoñwis_ or governors, and the office dates from early times; but these pueblo chiefs have no authority over pueblos other than their own.
