In the case of _taste_, therefore, as in the case of smell, we could not, from the simple sensations,--if these alone had been given to us,--have derived any knowledge of an external world, of substances extended and resisting; but we consider them as sensations, in the strict philosophic meaning of the term, because we have previously acquired our belief of an external world. It may be remarked of these two classes of sensations, now considered, that they have a greater mutual resemblance, than our sensations of any other kind. It is only a _blind_ man who thinks, that what is called _scarlet_ is like the sound of a trumpet; but there are _tastes_ which we consider as like _smells_, in the same manner as we consider them to be like other tastes; and, if we had not acquired a distinct knowledge of the seats of our different organs, and had yet known that smells and tastes arose from external causes acting upon some one or other of these, we should probably have been greatly puzzled, in many cases, in our attempt to refer the particular sensation to its particular organ. In considering the advantages which we derive from our organs of _smell_ and _taste_, the mere pleasures which they directly afford, as a part of the general happiness of life, are to be regarded, from their frequent occurrence, as of no considerable amount. The fragrance of the fields enters largely into that obscure but delightful group of images, which rise in our minds on the mere names of _spring_, _summer_, the _country_, and seems to represent the very form of ethereal purity, as if it were the breath of heaven itself. If we imagine all the innumerable flowers which nature pours out, like a tribute of incense to the God who is adorning her, again to be stripped, in a single moment, of their odour, though they were to retain all their bright diversities of colouring, it would seem as if they were deprived of a spirit which animates them,--how cold and dead would they instantly become,--and how much should we lose of that vernal joy, which renders the season of blossoms almost a new life to ourselves. “In vain the golden Morn aloft Waves her dew-bespangled wing; With vermeil cheek and whisper soft She woos the tardy Spring; Till April starts, and calls around The sleeping fragrance from the ground,”[75] It is by this delightful quality that the tribes of vegetable life seem to hold a sort of social and spiritual communion with us. It is, as it were, the voice with which they address us, and a voice which speaks only of happiness. To him who walks among the flowers which he has tended, “Each odoriferous leaf, Each opening blossom, freely breathes abroad Its gratitude, and thanks him with its sweets.” The pleasures of the sense of _taste_, in the moderate enjoyment of which there is nothing reprehensible, are, in a peculiar manner, associated with family happiness. To have met frequently at the same board, is no small part of many of the delightful remembrances of friendship; and to meet _again_ at the same board, after years of absence, is a pleasure that almost makes atonement for the long and dreary interval between. In some half-civilized countries, in which the influence of simple feelings of this kind is at once more forcible in itself, and less obscured in the confusion of ever varying frivolities and passions, this hospitable bond forms, as you well know, one of the strongest ties of mutual obligation, sufficient often to check the impetuosity of vindictive passions which no other remembrance could, in the moment of fury, restrain. Had there been no _pleasure_ attached to a repast, independent of the mere relief from the pain of hunger, the coarse and equal food would probably have been taken by each individual _apart_, and might even, like our other animal necessities, have been associated with feelings which would have rendered solitude a duty of external decorum. It would not be easy, even for those who have been accustomed to trace a simple cause through all its remotest operations, to say, how much of happiness, and how much even of the warm tenderness of virtue, would be destroyed, by the change of manners, which should simply put an end to the _social meal_; that meal which now calls all the members of a family to suspend their cares for a while, and to enjoy that cheerfulness, which is best reflected from others, and which can be permanent only when it is so reflected, from _soul_ to _soul_, and from _eye_ to _eye_. One very important advantage, more directly obvious than this, and of a kind which every one may be disposed more readily to admit, is afforded by our senses of smell and taste, in guiding our _selection_ of the substances which we take as alimentary.
