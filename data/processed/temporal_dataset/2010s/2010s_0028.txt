I must therefore submit it to Publick Judgment how full your Reflexion hits, or is wide of me, and can only say to it in the mean time,--_Valeat quantum valere potest_. In your Remark upon the same Lines you say, "_Eusden_ no sooner died, but his Place of Laureat was supply'd by _Cibber_, in the Year 1730, on which was made the following Epigram." (May I not believe by yourself?) _In merry_ Old England, _it once was a Rule, The King had his Poet, and also his Fool. But now we're so frugal, I'd have you to know it, That_ Cibber _can serve both for Fool and for Poet._ Ay, marry Sir! here you souse me with a Witness! This is a Triumph indeed! I can hardly help laughing at this myself; for, _Se non e vero, ben Trovato_! A good Jest is a good Thing, let it fall upon who it will: I dare say _Cibber_ would never have complain'd of Mr. _Pope_, ----_Si sic_ ----_Omnia dixisset_------ Juv. If he had never said any worse of him. But hold, Master _Cibber_! why may not you as well turn this pleasant Epigram into an involuntary Compliment? for a King's Fool was no body's Fool but his Master's, and had not his Name for nothing; as for Example, _Those Fools of old, if Fame says true, Were chiefly chosen for their Wit; Why then, call'd Fools? because, like you Dear_ Pope, _too Bold in shewing it._ And so, if I am the King's Fool; now, Sir, pray whose Fool are you? 'Tis pity, methinks, you should be out of Employment: for, if a satyrical Intrepidity, or, as you somewhere call it, a _High Courage of Wit_, is the fairest Pretence to be the _King's Fool_, I don't know a Wit in the World so fit to fill up the Post as yourself. Thus, Sir, I have endeavour'd to shake off all the Dirt in your _Dunciad_, unless of here and there some little Spots of your Ill-will, that were not worth tiring the Reader's Patience with my Notice of them. But I have some more foul way to trot through still, in your Epistles and Satyrs, _&c._ Now whether I shall come home the filthy Fellow, or the clean contrary Man to what you make me, I will venture to leave to your own _Conscience_, though I dare not make the same Trust to your _Wit_: For that you have often _spoke_ worse (merely to shew your Wit) than you could possibly _think_ of me, almost all your Readers, that observe your Good-nature _will easily_ believe. However, to shew I am not blind to your Merit, I own your Epistle to Dr. _Arbuthnot_ (though I there find myself contemptibly spoken of) gives me more Delight in the whole, than any one Poem of the kind I ever read. The only Prejudice or wrong Bias of Judgment, I am afraid I may be guilty of is, when I cannot help thinking, that your Wit is more remarkably bare and barren, whenever it would fall foul upon _Cibber_, than upon any other Person or Occasion whatsoever: I therefore could wish the Reader may have sometimes considered those Passages, that if I do you Injustice, he may as justly condemn me for it. In this Epistle ver. 59. of your Folio Edition, you seem to bless yourself, that you are not my Friend! no wonder then, you rail at me! but let us see upon what Occasion you own this Felicity. Speaking of an impertinent Author, who teized you to recommend his _Virgin Tragedy_ to the Stage, you at last happily got rid of him with this Excuse---- _There (thank my Stars) my whole Commission ends,_ Cibber _and I, are luckily no Friends._ If you chose not to be mine, Sir, it does not follow, that it was equally my Choice not to be yours: But perhaps you thought me your Enemy, because you were conscious you had injur'd me, and therefore were resolv'd never to forgive _Me_, because I had it in my Power to forgive _You_: For, as _Dryden_ says, _Forgiveness, to the Injur'd does belong; But they ne'er pardon who have done the Wrong._ This, Sir, is the only natural Excuse, I can form, for your being my Enemy. As to your blunt Assertion of my certain Prejudice to any thing, that had your Recommendation to the Stage, which your above Lines would insinuate; I gave you a late Instance in _The Miller of Mansfield_, that your manner of treating Me had in no sort any Influence upon my Judgment. For you may remember, sometime before that Piece was acted, I accidentally met you, in a Visit to the late General _Dormer_, who, though he might be your good Friend, was not for that Reason the less a Friend to Me: There you join'd with that Gentleman, in asking my Advice and Assistance in that Author's behalf; which as I had read the Piece, though I had then never seen the Man, I gave, in such manner, as I thought might best serve him: And if I don't over-rate my Recommendation, I believe its way to the Stage was made the more easy by it. This Fact, then, does in no kind make good your Insinuation, that my Enmity to you would not suffer me to like any thing that you liked; which though you call your good Fortune in Verse, yet in Prose, you see, it happens not to be true.
