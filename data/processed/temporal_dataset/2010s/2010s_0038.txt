He sold his share in the property in 1776 for £35,000, and took leave of the stage by playing a round of his favourite characters--Hamlet, Lear, Richard and Benedick, among Shakespearian parts; Lusignan in _Zara_, Aaron Hill's adaptation of Voltaire's _Zaire_; and Kitely in his own adaptation of Ben Jonson's _Every Man in his Humour_; Archer in Farquhar's _Beaux' Stratagem_; Abel Drugger in Ben Jonson's _Alchemist_; Sir John Brute in Vanbrugh's _Provoked Wife_; Leon in Fletcher's _Rule a Wife and have a Wife_. He ended the series, as Tate Wilkinson says, "in full glory" with "the youthful Don Felix" in Mrs Centlivre's _Wonder_ on the 10th of June 1776. He died in London on the 20th of January 1779. He was buried in Westminster Abbey at the foot of Shakespeare's statue with imposing solemnities. An elegy on his death was published by William Tasker, poet and physiognomist, in the same year. In person, Garrick was a little below middle height; in his later years he seems to have inclined to stoutness. The extraordinary mobility of his whole person, and his power of as it were transforming himself at will, are attested by many anecdotes and descriptions, but the piercing power of his eye must have been his most irresistible feature. Johnson, of whose various and often merely churlish remarks on Garrick and his doings many are scattered through the pages of Boswell, spoke warmly of the elegance and sprightliness of his friend's conversation, as well as of his liberality and kindness of heart; while to the great actor's art he paid the exquisite tribute of describing Garrick's sudden death as having "eclipsed the gaiety of nations, and impoverished the public stock of harmless pleasure." But the most discriminating character of Garrick, slightly tinged with satire, is that drawn by Goldsmith in his poem of _Retaliation_. Beyond a doubt he was not without a certain moral timidity contrasting strangely with his eager temperament and alertness of intellect; but, though he was not cast in a heroic mould, he must have been one of the most amiable of men. Garrick was often happy in his epigrams and occasional verse, including his numerous prologues and epilogues. He had the good taste to recognize, and the spirit to make public his recognition of, the excellence of Gray's odes at a time when they were either ridiculed or neglected. His dramatic pieces, _The Lying Valet_, adapted from Motteux's _Novelty Lethe_ (1740), _The Guardian_, _Linco's Travels_ (1767), _Miss in her Teens_ (1747), _Irish Widow_, &c., and his alterations and adaptations of old plays, which together fill four volumes, evinced his knowledge of stage effect and his appreciation of lively dialogue and action; but he cannot be said to have added one new or original character to the drama. He was joint author with Colman of _The Clandestine Marriage_ (1766), in which he is said to have written his famous part of Lord Ogleby. The excellent farce, _High Life below Stairs_, appears to have been wrongly attributed to Garrick, and to be by James Townley. His _Dramatic Works_ (1798) fill three, his _Poetic_ (1735) two volumes. Garrick's _Private Correspondence_ (published in 1831-1832 with a short memoir by Boaden, in 2 vols. 4to), which includes his extensive _Foreign Correspondence_ with distinguished French men and women, and the notices of him in the memoirs of Cumberland, Hannah More and Madame D'Arblay, and above all in Boswell's _Life of Johnson_, bear testimony to his many attractive qualities as a companion and to his fidelity as a friend. BIBLIOGRAPHY.--A collection of unprinted Garrick letters is in the Forster library at South Kensington. A list of publications of all kinds for and against Garrick will be found in R. Lowe's _Bibliographical History of English Theatrical Literature_ (1887). The earlier biographies of Garrick are by Arthur Murphy (2 vols., 1801) and by the bookseller Tom Davies (2 vols., 4th ed., 1805), the latter a work of some merit, but occasionally inaccurate and confused as to dates; and a searching if not altogether sympathetic survey of his verses is furnished by Joseph Knight's valuable Life (1894). A memoir of Garrick is included in a volume of French _Memoirs of Mlle Clairon and others_, published by Levain (H.L. Cain) at Paris in 1846; and an Italian _Biografia di Davide Garrick_ was published by C. Blasis at Milan in 1840. Mr Percy Fitzgerald's _Life_ (2 vols., 1868; new edition, 1899) is full and spirited, and has been reprinted, with additions, among Sir Theodore Martin's _Monographs_ (1906). A delightful essay on Garrick appeared in the _Quarterly Review_ (July 1868), directing attention to the admirable criticisms of Garrick's acting in 1775 in the letters of G.C. Lichtenberg (_Verm. Schriften_, iii., Göttingen, 1801). See also for a very valuable survey of Garrick's labours as an actor, with a bibliography, C. Gaehde, _David Garrick als Shakespeare-Darsteller_, &c. (Berlin, 1904).
