The Blue Morning Glory.] The Blue Mountain Lory spends most of his time In climbing about in a tropical clime; We therefore our efforts need only confine, To minutely observing the climb of the Vine. The Quail. The Kale. [Illustration: The Quail. The Kale.] The California Quail is said To have a tail upon his head, While contrary-wise we style the Kale, A cabbage head upon a tail. It is not hard to tell the two, The Quail commences with a queue. The Pecan. The Toucan. [Illustration: The Pecan. The Toucan.] Very few can Tell the Toucan From the Pecan-- Here's a new plan: To take the Toucan from the tree, Requires im-mense a-gil-i-tee, While _any one_ can pick with ease The Pecans from the Pecan trees: It's such an easy thing to do, That even the Toucan he can too. The Auk. The Orchid. [Illustration: The Auk. The Orchid.] We seldom meet, when out to walk, Either the Orchid or the Auk; The Auk indeed is only known To dwellers in the Auktic zone, While Orchids can be found in legions, Within the equatorial regions. The graceful Orchid on its stalk, Resembles so the auk-ward Auk; 'T is plain we must some means discover, To tell the two from one another: The obvious difference, to be sure, Is merely one of temperature. * * * * * [Illustration] For Eskimos, perhaps, the Auk Performs the duties of the Stork. The Cat-bird. The Cat-nip. [Illustration: The Cat-bird. The Cat-nip.] The Cat-bird's call resembles that, Emitted by the Pussy Cat, While Cat-nip, growing by the wall, Is never known to caterwaul: Its odor though attracts the Kits, And throws them in Catniption fits. [Illustration] The Ibis. The 'Ibiscus. [Illustration: The Ibis. The 'Ibiscus.] The sacred Ibis tells his beads, And gravely from his prayer-book reads; The Ibis therfore we may say, Is classified a bird-of-prey. 'Ibiscus we have heard related, The "Crimson-Eye" is designated; Their difference is plain indeed, The flower is red, the bird can read. The Butter-ball. The Butter-cup. [Illustration: The Butter-ball. The Butter-cup.] The little Butter-cup can sing, From morn 'till night like anything: The quacking of the Butter-ball, Cannot be called a song at all. We thus the flower may learn to know, Its song is reproduced below. [Illustration] The Bay. The Jay. [Illustration: The Bay. The Jay.] The Blue-Jay, as we plainly see, Resembles much the green Bay tree: The difference between the two, Is ob-vi-ous-ly one of hue. Though this is not the only way, To tell the Blue-Jay from the Bay. The Pipe. The Snipe. [Illustration: The Pipe. The Snipe.] Observe the common Indian Pipe, Likewise the high-bred English Snipe, Who is distinguished, as we see, By his superior pedigree. [Illustration: Two crosses botonny bend sinister.] [Illustration: Fess argent mantlets sable.] The Roc. The Shamrock. [Illustration: The Roc. The Shamrock.] Observe how peacefully the Cows Among the little Shamrocks browse, In contrast with their actions frantic When they perceive the Roc gigantic; We need but watch thei_r oc_upation, And seek no other explanation. The Lark. The Larkspur. [Illustration: The Lark. The Larkspur.] The Larkspur's likeness to the Lark Is surely worthy of remark, Although to see it we require The aid of a small magnifier, Which circumstance of course implies, Their difference is one of size. Puffin. Nuffin. [Illustration: Puffin. Nuffin.] Upon this cake of ice is perched, The paddle-footed Puffin: To find his double we have searched, But have discovered--Nuffin! Author's Apology. Not every one is always able To recognize a vegetable, For some are guided by tradition, While others use their intuition, And even I make no pretense Of having more than common sense; Indeed these strange homologies Are in most flornithologies, And I have freely drawn upon The works of Gray and Audubon, Avoiding though the frequent blunders Of those who study Nature's wonders.
