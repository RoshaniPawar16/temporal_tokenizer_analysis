Book 33 Micah
001:001 The word of Yahweh that came to Micah the Morashtite in the days
        of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw
        concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.
001:002 Hear, you peoples, all of you.  Listen, O earth, and all that
        is therein:  and let the Lord Yahweh be witness against you,
        the Lord from his holy temple.
001:003 For, behold, Yahweh comes forth out of his place, and will come
        down and tread on the high places of the earth.
001:004 The mountains melt under him, and the valleys split apart,
        like wax before the fire, like waters that are poured down
        a steep place.
001:005 "All this is for the disobedience of Jacob, and for the sins
        of the house of Israel.  What is the disobedience
        of Jacob?  Isn't it Samaria?  And what are the high places
        of Judah?  Aren't they Jerusalem?
001:006 Therefore I will make Samaria like a rubble heap of the field,
        like places for planting vineyards; and I will pour down its
        stones into the valley, and I will uncover its foundations.
001:007 All her idols will be beaten to pieces, and all her temple gifts
        will be burned with fire, and all her images I will destroy;
        for of the hire of a prostitute has she gathered them,
        and to the hire of a prostitute shall they return."
001:008 For this I will lament and wail; I will go stripped and naked;
        I will howl like the jackals, and moan like the daughters of owls.
001:009 For her wounds are incurable; for it has come even to Judah.
        It reaches to the gate of my people, even to Jerusalem.
001:010 Don't tell it in Gath.  Don't weep at all.  At Beth Ophrah{Beth Ophrah
        means literally "House of Dust."} I have rolled myself
        in the dust.
001:011 Pass on, inhabitant of Shaphir, in nakedness and shame.
        The inhabitant of Zaanan won't come out.  The wailing
        of Beth Ezel will take from you his protection.
001:012 For the inhabitant of Maroth waits anxiously for good,
        because evil has come down from Yahweh to the gate of Jerusalem.
001:013 Harness the chariot to the swift steed, inhabitant of Lachish.
        She was the beginning of sin to the daughter of Zion; For the
        transgressions of Israel were found in you.
001:014 Therefore you will give a parting gift to Moresheth Gath.
        The houses of Achzib will be a deceitful thing to the
        kings of Israel.
001:015 I will yet bring to you, inhabitant of Mareshah.
        He who is the glory of Israel will come to Adullam.
001:016 Shave your heads, and cut off your hair for the children
        of your delight.  Enlarge your baldness like the vulture;
        for they have gone into captivity from you!
002:001 Woe to those who devise iniquity and work evil on their beds!
        When the morning is light, they practice it, because it
        is in the power of their hand.
002:002 They covet fields, and seize them; and houses, and take them away:
        and they oppress a man and his house, even a man and his heritage.
002:003 Therefore thus says Yahweh:  "Behold, I am planning against these
        people a disaster, from which you will not remove your necks,
        neither will you walk haughtily; for it is an evil time.
002:004 In that day they will take up a parable against you, and lament
        with a doleful lamentation, saying, 'We are utterly ruined!
        My people's possession is divided up.  Indeed he takes it
        from me and assigns our fields to traitors!'"
002:005 Therefore you will have no one who divides the land by lot
        in the assembly of Yahweh.
002:006 "Don't prophesy!"  They prophesy.  "Don't prophesy about
        these things.  Disgrace won't overtake us."
002:007 Shall it be said, O house of Jacob:  "Is the Spirit of Yahweh angry?
        Are these his doings?  Don't my words do good to him
        who walks blamelessly?"
002:008 But lately my people have risen up as an enemy.  You strip
        the robe and clothing from those who pass by without a care,
        returning from battle.
002:009 You drive the women of my people out from their pleasant houses;
        from their young children you take away my blessing forever.
002:010 Arise, and depart!  For this is not your resting place, because of
        uncleanness that destroys, even with a grievous destruction.
002:011 If a man walking in a spirit of falsehood lies:
        "I will prophesy to you of wine and of strong drink;"
        he would be the prophet of this people.
002:012 I will surely assemble, Jacob, all of you; I will surely gather
        the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep
        of Bozrah, as a flock in the midst of their pasture;
        they will swarm with people.
002:013 He who breaks open the way goes up before them.
        They break through the gate, and go out.  And their king
        passes on before them, with Yahweh at their head.
003:001 I said, "Please listen, you heads of Jacob, and rulers
        of the house of Israel:  Isn't it for you to know justice?
003:002 You who hate the good, and love the evil; who tear off their skin,
        and their flesh from off their bones;
003:003 who also eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from
        off them, and break their bones, and chop them in pieces,
        as for the pot, and as flesh within the caldron.
003:004 Then they will cry to Yahweh, but he will not answer them.
        Yes, he will hide his face from them at that time, because they
        made their deeds evil."
003:005 Thus says Yahweh concerning the prophets who lead my people astray;
        for those who feed their teeth, they proclaim, "Peace!"
        and whoever doesn't provide for their mouths, they prepare
        war against him:
003:006 "Therefore night is over you, with no vision, and it is dark
        to you, that you may not divine; and the sun will go down on
        the prophets, and the day will be black over them.
003:007 The seers shall be disappointed, and the diviners confounded.
        Yes, they shall all cover their lips; for there is no
        answer from God."
003:008 But as for me, I am full of power by the Spirit of Yahweh,
        and of judgment, and of might, to declare to Jacob his disobedience,
        and to Israel his sin.
003:009 Please listen to this, you heads of the house of Jacob,
        and rulers of the house of Israel, who abhor justice,
        and pervert all equity.
003:010 They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity.
003:011 Her leaders judge for bribes, and her priests teach for a price,
        and her prophets of it tell fortunes for money:  yet they
        lean on Yahweh, and say, "Isn't Yahweh in the midst of us?
        No disaster will come on us."
003:012 Therefore Zion for your sake will be plowed like a field,
        and Jerusalem will become heaps of rubble, and the mountain
        of the temple like the high places of a forest.
004:001 But in the latter days, it will happen that the mountain of
        Yahweh's temple will be established on the top of the mountains,
        and it will be exalted above the hills; and peoples will
        stream to it.
004:002 Many nations will go and say, "Come, and let us go up to
        the mountain of Yahweh, and to the house of the God of Jacob;
        and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths."
        For out of Zion will go forth the law, and the word of
        Yahweh from Jerusalem;
004:003 and he will judge between many peoples, and will decide
        concerning strong nations afar off.  They will beat their
        swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks.
        Nation will not lift up sword against nation, neither will
        they learn war any more.
004:004 But they will sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree;
        and no one will make them afraid:  For the mouth of Yahweh
        of Armies has spoken.
004:005 Indeed all the nations may walk in the name of their gods;
        but we will walk in the name of Yahweh our God forever and ever.
004:006 "In that day," says Yahweh, "I will assemble that which is lame,
        and I will gather that which is driven away, and that which
        I have afflicted;
004:007 and I will make that which was lame a remnant, and that which
        was cast far off a strong nation:  and Yahweh will reign
        over them on Mount Zion from then on, even forever."
004:008 You, tower of the flock, the hill of the daughter of Zion,
        to you it will come, yes, the former dominion will come,
        the kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem.
004:009 Now why do you cry out aloud?  Is there no king in you?
        Has your counselor perished, that pains have taken hold of you
        as of a woman in travail?
004:010 Be in pain, and labor to bring forth, daughter of Zion, like a
        woman in travail; for now you will go forth out of the city,
        and will dwell in the field, and will come even to Babylon.
        There you will be rescued.  There Yahweh will redeem you
        from the hand of your enemies.
004:011 Now many nations have assembled against you, that say,
        "Let her be defiled, and let our eye gloat over Zion."
004:012 But they don't know the thoughts of Yahweh, neither do they
        understand his counsel; for he has gathered them like the sheaves
        to the threshing floor.
004:013 Arise and thresh, daughter of Zion; for I will make your horn iron,
        and I will make your hoofs brass; and you will beat in pieces
        many peoples:  and I will devote their gain to Yahweh,
        and their substance to the Lord of the whole earth.
005:001 Now you shall gather yourself in troops, daughter of troops.
        He has laid siege against us.  They will strike the judge
        of Israel with a rod on the cheek.
005:002 But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, being small among the clans of Judah,
        out of you one will come forth to me that is to be ruler in Israel;
        whose goings forth are from of old, from everlasting.
005:003 Therefore he will abandon them until the time that she who is
        in labor gives birth.  Then the rest of his brothers will
        return to the children of Israel.
005:004 He shall stand, and shall shepherd in the strength
        of Yahweh, in the majesty of the name of Yahweh his God:
        and they will live, for then he will be great to the ends
        of the earth.
005:005 He will be our peace when Assyria invades our land,
        and when he marches through our fortresses, then we will raise
        against him seven shepherds, and eight leaders of men.
005:006 They will rule the land of Assyria with the sword, and the land
        of Nimrod in its gates.  He will deliver us from the Assyrian,
        when he invades our land, and when he marches within our border.
005:007 The remnant of Jacob will be in the midst of many peoples,
        like dew from Yahweh, like showers on the grass, that don't
        wait for man, nor wait for the sons of men.
005:008 The remnant of Jacob will be among the nations, in the midst
        of many peoples, like a lion among the animals of the forest,
        like a young lion among the flocks of sheep; who, if he
        goes through, treads down and tears in pieces, and there
        is no one to deliver.
005:009 Let your hand be lifted up above your adversaries, and let
        all of your enemies be cut off.
005:010 "It will happen in that day," says Yahweh, "That I will
        cut off your horses out of the midst of you, and will
        destroy your chariots.
005:011 I will cut off the cities of your land, and will tear down
        all your strongholds.
005:012 I will destroy witchcraft from your hand; and you shall
        have no soothsayers.
005:013 I will cut off your engraved images and your pillars out
        of your midst; and you shall no more worship the work
        of your hands.
005:014 I will uproot your Asherim out of your midst; and I will
        destroy your cities.
005:015 I will execute vengeance in anger, and wrath on the nations
        that didn't listen."
006:001 Listen now to what Yahweh says:  "Arise, plead your case before
        the mountains, and let the hills hear what you have to say.
006:002 Hear, you mountains, Yahweh's controversy, and you enduring
        foundations of the earth; for Yahweh has a controversy
        with his people, and he will contend with Israel.
006:003 My people, what have I done to you?  How have I burdened you?
        Answer me!
006:004 For I brought you up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed
        you out of the house of bondage.  I sent before you
        Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.
006:005 My people, remember now what Balak king of Moab devised,
        and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him from Shittim
        to Gilgal, that you may know the righteous acts of Yahweh."
006:006 How shall I come before Yahweh, and bow myself before the
        exalted God?  Shall I come before him with burnt offerings,
        with calves a year old?
006:007 Will Yahweh be pleased with thousands of rams?  With tens of thousands
        of rivers of oil?  Shall I give my firstborn for my disobedience?
        The fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?
006:008 He has shown you, O man, what is good.  What does Yahweh require
        of you, but to act justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly
        with your God?
006:009 Yahweh's voice calls to the city, and wisdom sees your name:
        "Listen to the rod, and he who appointed it.
006:010 Are there yet treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked,
        and a short ephah{An ephah is a measure of volume, and a short
        ephah is made smaller than a full ephah for the purpose
        of cheating customers.} that is accursed?
006:011 Shall I be pure with dishonest scales, and with a bag
        of deceitful weights?
006:012 Her rich men are full of violence, her inhabitants speak lies,
        and their tongue is deceitful in their speech.
006:013 Therefore I also have struck you with a grievous wound.
        I have made you desolate because of your sins.
006:014 You shall eat, but not be satisfied.  Your humiliation
        will be in your midst.  You will store up, but not save;
        and that which you save I will give up to the sword.
006:015 You will sow, but won't reap.  You will tread the olives,
        but won't anoint yourself with oil; and crush grapes,
        but won't drink the wine.
006:016 For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the house
        of Ahab.  You walk in their counsels, that I may make you a ruin,
        and her inhabitants a hissing; And you will bear the reproach
        of my people."
007:001 Misery is mine!  Indeed, I am like one who gathers the summer fruits,
        as gleanings of the vineyard:  There is no cluster of grapes to eat.
        My soul desires to eat the early fig.
007:002 The godly man has perished out of the earth, and there is
        no one upright among men.  They all lie in wait for blood;
        every man hunts his brother with a net.
007:003 Their hands are on that which is evil to do it diligently.
        The ruler and judge ask for a bribe; and the powerful man dictates
        the evil desire of his soul.  Thus they conspire together.
007:004 The best of them is like a brier.  The most upright is worse than
        a thorn hedge.  The day of your watchmen, even your visitation,
        has come; now is the time of their confusion.
007:005 Don't trust in a neighbor.  Don't put confidence in a friend.
        With the woman lying in your embrace, be careful of the words
        of your mouth!
007:006 For the son dishonors the father, the daughter rises up against
        her mother, the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law;
        a man's enemies are the men of his own house.
007:007 But as for me, I will look to Yahweh.  I will wait for the God
        of my salvation.  My God will hear me.
007:008 Don't rejoice against me, my enemy.  When I fall, I will arise.
        When I sit in darkness, Yahweh will be a light to me.
007:009 I will bear the indignation of Yahweh, because I have
        sinned against him, until he pleads my case, and executes
        judgment for me.  He will bring me forth to the light.
        I will see his righteousness.
007:010 Then my enemy will see it, and shame will cover her who said to me,
        where is Yahweh your God?  Then my enemy will see me and will
        cover her shame.  Now she will be trodden down like the mire
        of the streets.
007:011 A day to build your walls--In that day, he will extend your boundary.
007:012 In that day they will come to you from Assyria and the cities
        of Egypt, and from Egypt even to the River, and from sea to sea,
        and mountain to mountain.
007:013 Yet the land will be desolate because of those who dwell therein,
        for the fruit of their doings.
007:014 Shepherd your people with your staff, the flock of your heritage,
        who dwell by themselves in a forest, in the midst of
        fertile pasture land, let them feed; in Bashan and Gilead,
        as in the days of old.
007:015 "As in the days of your coming forth out of the land
        of Egypt, I will show them marvelous things."
007:016 The nations will see and be ashamed of all their might.
        They will lay their hand on their mouth.  Their ears
        will be deaf.
007:017 They will lick the dust like a serpent.  Like crawling things
        of the earth they shall come trembling out of their dens.
        They will come with fear to Yahweh our God, and will be afraid
        because of you.
007:018 Who is a God like you, who pardons iniquity, and passes
        over the disobedience of the remnant of his heritage?
        He doesn't retain his anger forever, because he delights
        in loving kindness.
007:019 He will again have compassion on us.  He will tread our iniquities
        under foot; and you will cast all their sins into the depths
        of the sea.
007:020 You will give truth to Jacob, and mercy to Abraham, as you
        have sworn to our fathers from the days of old.

        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up

and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
