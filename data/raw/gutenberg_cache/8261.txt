Book 34 Nahum
001:001 An oracle about Nineveh.  The book of the vision of
        Nahum the Elkoshite.
001:002 Yahweh is a jealous God and avenges.  Yahweh avenges and is
        full of wrath.  Yahweh takes vengeance on his adversaries,
        and he maintains wrath against his enemies.
001:003 Yahweh is slow to anger, and great in power, and will by no
        means leave the guilty unpunished.  Yahweh has his way in
        the whirlwind and in the storm, and the clouds are the dust
        of his feet.
001:004 He rebukes the sea, and makes it dry, and dries up all the rivers.
        Bashan languishes, and Carmel; and the flower of Lebanon languishes.
001:005 The mountains quake before him, and the hills melt away.
        The earth trembles at his presence, yes, the world, and all
        who dwell in it.
001:006 Who can stand before his indignation?  Who can endure the
        fierceness of his anger?  His wrath is poured out like fire,
        and the rocks are broken apart by him.
001:007 Yahweh is good, a stronghold in the day of trouble;
        and he knows those who take refuge in him.
001:008 But with an overflowing flood, he will make a full end of her place,
        and will pursue his enemies into darkness.
001:009 What do you plot against Yahweh?  He will make a full end.
        Affliction won't rise up the second time.
001:010 For entangled like thorns, and drunken as with their drink,
        they are consumed utterly like dry stubble.
001:011 There is one gone forth out of you, who devises evil against Yahweh,
        who counsels wickedness.
001:012 Thus says Yahweh:  "Though they be in full strength, and likewise
        many, even so they will be cut down, and he shall pass away.
        Though I have afflicted you, I will afflict you no more.
001:013 Now will I break his yoke from off you, and will burst
        your bonds apart."
001:014 Yahweh has commanded concerning you:  "No more descendants
        will bear your name.  Out of the house of your gods,
        will I cut off the engraved image and the molten image.
        I will make your grave, for you are vile."
001:015 Behold, on the mountains the feet of him who brings good news,
        who publishes peace!  Keep your feasts, Judah!  Perform your vows,
        for the wicked one will no more pass through you.
        He is utterly cut off.
002:001 He who dashes in pieces has come up against you.
        Keep the fortress!  Watch the way!  Strengthen your waist!
        Fortify your power mightily!
002:002 For Yahweh restores the excellency of Jacob, as the excellency
        of Israel; for the destroyers have destroyed them, and ruined
        their vine branches.
002:003 The shield of his mighty men is made red.  The valiant men
        are in scarlet.  The chariots flash with steel in the day
        of his preparation, and the pine spears are brandished.
002:004 The chariots rage in the streets.  They rush back and forth
        in the broad ways.  Their appearance is like torches.
        They run like the lightnings.
002:005 He summons his picked troops.  They stumble on their way.
        They dash to its wall, and the protective shield is put in place.
002:006 The gates of the rivers are opened, and the palace is dissolved.
002:007 It is decreed:  she is uncovered, she is carried away;
        and her handmaids moan as with the voice of doves,
        beating on their breasts.
002:008 But Nineveh has been from of old like a pool of water, yet they
        flee away.  "Stop!  Stop!" they cry, but no one looks back.
002:009 Take the spoil of silver.  Take the spoil of gold, for there
        is no end of the store, the glory of all goodly furniture.
002:010 She is empty, void, and waste.  The heart melts, the knees
        knock together, their bodies and faces have grown pale.
002:011 Where is the den of the lions, and the feeding place
        of the young lions, where the lion and the lioness walked,
        the lion's cubs, and no one made them afraid?
002:012 The lion tore in pieces enough for his cubs, and strangled
        for his lionesses, and filled his caves with the kill,
        and his dens with prey.
002:013 "Behold, I am against you," says Yahweh of Armies, "and I
        will burn her chariots in the smoke, and the sword will devour
        your young lions; and I will cut off your prey from the earth,
        and the voice of your messengers will no longer be heard."
003:001 Woe to the bloody city!  It is all full of lies and robbery.
        The prey doesn't depart.
003:002 The noise of the whip, the noise of the rattling of wheels,
        prancing horses, and bounding chariots,
003:003 the horseman mounting, and the flashing sword, the glittering spear,
        and a multitude of slain, and a great heap of corpses,
        and there is no end of the bodies.  They stumble on their bodies,
003:004 because of the multitude of the prostitution of the alluring
        prostitute, the mistress of witchcraft, who sells nations
        through her prostitution, and families through her witchcraft.
003:005 "Behold, I am against you," says Yahweh of Armies, "and I
        will lift your skirts over your face.  I will show the nations
        your nakedness, and the kingdoms your shame.
003:006 I will throw abominable filth on you, and make you vile,
        and will set you a spectacle.
003:007 It will happen that all those who look at you will flee from you,
        and say, 'Nineveh is laid waste!  Who will mourn for her?'
        Where will I seek comforters for you?"
003:008 Are you better than No-Amon,{or, Thebes} who was situated among
        the rivers, who had the waters around her; whose rampart
        was the sea, and her wall was of the sea?
003:009 Cush and Egypt were her boundless strength.  Put and Libya
        were her helpers.
003:010 Yet was she carried away.  She went into captivity.
        Her young children also were dashed in pieces at the head
        of all the streets, and they cast lots for her honorable men,
        and all her great men were bound in chains.
003:011 You also will be drunken.  You will be hidden.  You also will
        seek a stronghold because of the enemy.
003:012 All your fortresses will be like fig trees with the first-ripe figs:
        if they are shaken, they fall into the mouth of the eater.
003:013 Behold, your troops in your midst are women.
        The gates of your land are set wide open to your enemies.
        The fire has devoured your bars.
003:014 Draw water for the siege.  Strengthen your fortresses.
        Go into the clay, and tread the mortar.  Make the brick kiln strong.
003:015 There the fire will devour you.  The sword will cut you off.  It will
        devour you like the grasshopper.  Multiply like grasshoppers.
        Multiply like the locust.
003:016 You have increased your merchants more than the stars of the skies.
        The grasshopper strips, and flees away.
003:017 Your guards are like the locusts, and your officials like
        the swarms of locusts, which settle on the walls on a cold day,
        but when the sun appears, they flee away, and their place
        is not known where they are.
003:018 Your shepherds slumber, king of Assyria.  Your nobles lie down.
        Your people are scattered on the mountains, and there is no
        one to gather them.
003:019 There is no healing your wound, for your injury is fatal.
        All who hear the report of you clap their hands over you;
        for who hasn't felt your endless cruelty?

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
