Book 08 Ruth
001:001 It happened in the days when the judges judged, that there
        was a famine in the land.  A certain man of Bethlehem Judah
        went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife,
        and his two sons.
001:002 The name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi,
        and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of
        Bethlehem Judah.  They came into the country of Moab,
        and continued there.
001:003 Elimelech, Naomi's husband, died; and she was left,
        and her two sons.
001:004 They took them wives of the women of Moab; the name
        of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth:
        and they lived there about ten years.
001:005 Mahlon and Chilion died both of them; and the woman was left
        of her two children and of her husband.
001:006 Then she arose with her daughters-in-law, that she might return
        from the country of Moab:  for she had heard in the country of Moab
        how that Yahweh had visited his people in giving them bread.
001:007 She went forth out of the place where she was, and her two
        daughters-in-law with her; and they went on the way to return
        to the land of Judah.
001:008 Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, Go, return each
        of you to her mother's house:  Yahweh deal kindly with you,
        as you have dealt with the dead, and with me.
001:009 Yahweh grant you that you may find rest, each of you in the house
        of her husband.  Then she kissed them, and they lifted up
        their voice, and wept.
001:010 They said to her, No, but we will return with you to your people.
001:011 Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters:  why will you go with me?
        have I yet sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?
001:012 Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have
        a husband.  If I should say, I have hope, if I should even
        have a husband tonight, and should also bear sons;
001:013 would you therefore wait until they were grown? would you
        therefore stay from having husbands? nay, my daughters,
        for it grieves me much for your sakes, for the hand of Yahweh
        is gone forth against me.
001:014 They lifted up their voice, and wept again:  and Orpah kissed
        her mother-in-law, but Ruth joined with her.
001:015 She said, Behold, your sister-in-law is gone back to her people,
        and to her god:  return you after your sister-in-law.
001:016 Ruth said, "Don't entreat me to leave you, and to return
        from following after you, for where you go, I will go;
        and where you lodge, I will lodge; your people shall be my people,
        and your God my God;
001:017 where you die, will I die, and there will I be buried:
        Yahweh do so to me, and more also, if anything but death part
        you and me."
001:018 When she saw that she was steadfastly minded to go with her,
        she left off speaking to her.
001:019 So they two went until they came to Bethlehem.  It happened,
        when they were come to Bethlehem, that all the city was moved
        about them, and [the women] said, Is this Naomi?
001:020 She said to them, "Don't call me Naomi, call me Mara;
        for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me.
001:021 I went out full, and Yahweh has brought me home again empty;
        why do you call me Naomi, seeing Yahweh has testified against me,
        and the Almighty has afflicted me?"
001:022 So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law,
        with her, who returned out of the country of Moab:
        and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest.
002:001 Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, a mighty man of wealth,
        of the family of Elimelech, and his name was Boaz.
002:002 Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, Let me now go to the field,
        and glean among the ears of grain after him in whose sight
        I shall find favor.  She said to her, Go, my daughter.
002:003 She went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers:
        and she happened to come to the portion of the field belonging
        to Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech.
002:004 Behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said to the reapers,
        Yahweh be with you.  They answered him, Yahweh bless you.
002:005 Then said Boaz to his servant who was set over the reapers,
        Whose young lady is this?
002:006 The servant who was set over the reapers answered, It is the Moabite
        lady who came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab:
002:007 She said, Please let me glean and gather after the reapers
        among the sheaves.  So she came, and has continued even
        from the morning until now, except that she stayed a little
        in the house.
002:008 Then said Boaz to Ruth, Don't you hear, my daughter?
        Don't go to glean in another field, neither pass from hence,
        but abide here fast by my maidens.
002:009 Let your eyes be on the field that they reap, and go after them:
        haven't I charged the young men that they shall not touch
        you? and when you are thirsty, go to the vessels, and drink
        of that which the young men have drawn.
002:010 Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground,
        and said to him, Why have I found favor in your sight,
        that you should take knowledge of me, seeing I am a foreigner?
002:011 Boaz answered her, It has fully been shown me, all that you
        have done to your mother-in-law since the death of your husband;
        and how you have left your father and your mother,
        and the land of your birth, and have come to a people that you
        didn't know before.
002:012 Yahweh recompense your work, and a full reward be given you
        of Yahweh, the God of Israel, under whose wings you are come
        to take refuge.
002:013 Then she said, Let me find favor in your sight, my lord,
        because you have comforted me, and because you have spoken kindly
        to your handmaid, though I am not as one of your handmaidens.
002:014 At meal time Boaz said to her, Come here, and eat of the bread,
        and dip your morsel in the vinegar.  She sat beside the reapers,
        and they reached her parched grain, and she ate, and was sufficed,
        and left of it.
002:015 When she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his
        young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves,
        and don't reproach her.
002:016 Also pull out some for her from the bundles, and leave it,
        and let her glean, and don't rebuke her.
002:017 So she gleaned in the field until even; and she beat out that
        which she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley.
002:018 She took it up, and went into the city; and her mother-in-law
        saw what she had gleaned:  and she brought forth and gave
        to her that which she had left after she was sufficed.
002:019 Her mother-in-law said to her, Where have you gleaned today? and
        where have you worked? blessed be he who did take knowledge of you.
        She shown her mother-in-law with whom she had worked, and said,
        The man's name with whom I worked today is Boaz.
002:020 Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, Blessed be he of Yahweh,
        who has not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead.
        Naomi said to her, The man is a close relative to us,
        one of our near kinsmen.
002:021 Ruth the Moabitess said, Yes, he said to me, You shall keep
        fast by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest.
002:022 Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, It is good, my daughter,
        that you go out with his maidens, and that they not meet you
        in any other field.
002:023 So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz, to glean to the end
        of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and she lived
        with her mother-in-law.
003:001 Naomi her mother-in-law said to her, My daughter, shall I
        not seek rest for you, that it may be well with you?
003:002 Now isn't Boaz our kinsman, with whose maidens you were?
        Behold, he winnows barley tonight in the threshing floor.
003:003 Wash yourself therefore, and anoint you, and put your clothing
        on you, and get you down to the threshing floor, but don't
        make yourself known to the man, until he shall have done
        eating and drinking.
003:004 It shall be, when he lies down, that you shall mark the place
        where he shall lie, and you shall go in, and uncover his feet,
        and lay you down; and he will tell you what you shall do.
003:005 She said to her, All that you say I will do.
003:006 She went down to the threshing floor, and did according to all
        that her mother-in-law told her.
003:007 When Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry,
        he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain:
        and she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down.
003:008 It happened at midnight, that the man was afraid, and turned himself;
        and behold, a woman lay at his feet.
003:009 He said, Who are you?  She answered, I am Ruth your handmaid:
        spread therefore your skirt over your handmaid; for you are
        a near kinsman.
003:010 He said, Blessed are you by Yahweh, my daughter:
        you have shown more kindness in the latter end than at
        the beginning, inasmuch as you didn't follow young men,
        whether poor or rich.
003:011 Now, my daughter, don't be afraid; I will do to you all that
        you say; for all the city of my people does know that you
        are a worthy woman.
003:012 Now it is true that I am a near kinsman; however there is
        a kinsman nearer than I.
003:013 Stay this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he will
        perform to you the part of a kinsman, well; let him do the
        kinsman's part:  but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to you,
        then will I do the part of a kinsman to you, as Yahweh lives:
        lie down until the morning.
003:014 She lay at his feet until the morning.  She rose up before
        one could discern another.  For he said, Let it not be known
        that the woman came to the threshing floor.
003:015 He said, Bring the mantle that is on you, and hold it;
        and she held it; and he measured six [measures] of barley,
        and laid it on her:  and he went into the city.
003:016 When she came to her mother-in-law, she said, Who are you,
        my daughter?  She told her all that the man had done to her.
003:017 She said, These six [measures] of barley gave he me; for he said,
        "Don't go empty to your mother-in-law."
003:018 Then said she, "Sit still, my daughter, until you know how
        the matter will fall; for the man will not rest, until he has
        finished the thing this day."
004:001 Now Boaz went up to the gate, and sat him down there:
        and behold, the near kinsman of whom Boaz spoke came by;
        to whom he said, Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here.
        He turned aside, and sat down.
004:002 He took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit you
        down here.  They sat down.
004:003 He said to the near kinsman, Naomi, who has come back out
        of the country of Moab, is selling the parcel of land,
        which was our brother Elimelech's:
004:004 I thought to disclose it to you, saying, Buy it before
        those who sit here, and before the elders of my people.
        If you will redeem it, redeem it:  but if you will not
        redeem it, then tell me, that I may know; for there
        is none to redeem it besides you; and I am after you.
        He said, I will redeem it.
004:005 Then said Boaz, What day you buy the field of the hand of Naomi,
        you must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead,
        to raise up the name of the dead on his inheritance.
004:006 The near kinsman said, I can't redeem it for myself, lest I
        mar my own inheritance:  take my right of redemption on you;
        for I can't redeem it.
004:007 Now this was [the custom] in former time in Israel concerning
        redeeming and concerning exchanging, to confirm all things:
        a man drew off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbor;
        and this was the [manner of] attestation in Israel.
004:008 So the near kinsman said to Boaz, Buy it for yourself.
        He drew off his shoe.
004:009 Boaz said to the elders, and to all the people, You are witnesses
        this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech's,
        and all that was Chilion's and Mahlon's, of the hand of Naomi.
004:010 Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I
        purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead
        on his inheritance, that the name of the dead not be cut off
        from among his brothers, and from the gate of his place:
        you are witnesses this day.
004:011 All the people who were in the gate, and the elders, said, We
        are witnesses.  Yahweh make the woman who has come into your house
        like Rachel and like Leah, which two built the house of Israel:
        and do you worthily in Ephrathah, and be famous in Bethlehem:
004:012 and let your house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar
        bore to Judah, of the seed which Yahweh shall give you
        of this young woman.
004:013 So Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife; and he went in to her,
        and Yahweh gave her conception, and she bore a son.
004:014 The women said to Naomi, Blessed be Yahweh, who has not left
        you this day without a near kinsman; and let his name be
        famous in Israel.
004:015 He shall be to you a restorer of life, and sustain you
        in your old age, for your daughter-in-law, who loves you,
        who is better to you than seven sons, has borne him.
004:016 Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became
        nurse to it.
004:017 The women her neighbors gave it a name, saying, There is a son
        born to Naomi; and they named him Obed:  he is the father
        of Jesse, the father of David.
004:018 Now this is the history of the generations of Perez:  Perez became
        the father of Hezron,
004:019 and Hezron became the father of Ram, and Ram became
        the father of Amminadab,
004:020 and Amminadab became the father of Nahshon, and Nahshon became
        the father of Salmon,
004:021 and Salmon became the father of Boaz, and Boaz became
        the father of Obed,
004:022 and Obed became the father of Jesse, and Jesse became
        the father of David.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
