Book 65        Jude

65:001:001 Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to
           them that are sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in
           Jesus Christ, and called:

65:001:002 Mercy unto you, and peace, and love, be multiplied.

65:001:003 Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the
           common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and
           exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith
           which was once delivered unto the saints.

65:001:004 For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before
           of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the
           grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only
           Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ.

65:001:005 I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew
           this, how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the
           land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not.

65:001:006 And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left
           their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains
           under darkness unto the judgment of the great day.

65:001:007 Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like
           manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after
           strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the
           vengeance of eternal fire.

65:001:008 Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise
           dominion, and speak evil of dignities.

65:001:009 Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he
           disputed about the body of Moses, durst not bring against him
           a railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke thee.

65:001:010 But these speak evil of those things which they know not: but
           what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things
           they corrupt themselves.

65:001:011 Woe unto them! for they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran
           greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in
           the gainsaying of Core.

65:001:012 These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast
           with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are
           without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit
           withereth, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;

65:001:013 Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame;
           wandering stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness
           for ever.

65:001:014 And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these,
           saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his
           saints,

65:001:015 To execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are
           ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have
           ungodly committed, and of all their hard speeches which
           ungodly sinners have spoken against him.

65:001:016 These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own
           lusts; and their mouth speaketh great swelling words, having
           men's persons in admiration because of advantage.

65:001:017 But, beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken before
           of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ;

65:001:018 How that they told you there should be mockers in the last
           time, who should walk after their own ungodly lusts.

65:001:019 These be they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the
           Spirit.

65:001:020 But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy
           faith, praying in the Holy Ghost,

65:001:021 Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of
           our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.

65:001:022 And of some have compassion, making a difference:

65:001:023 And others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire;
           hating even the garment spotted by the flesh.

65:001:024 Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to
           present you faultless before the presence of his glory with
           exceeding joy,

65:001:025 To the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty,
           dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
