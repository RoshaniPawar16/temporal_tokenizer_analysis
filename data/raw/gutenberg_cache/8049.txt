Book 49        Ephesians

49:001:001 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the
           saints which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ
           Jesus:

49:001:002 Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the
           Lord Jesus Christ.

49:001:003 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who
           hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
           places in Christ:

49:001:004 According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of
           the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him
           in love:

49:001:005 Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus
           Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,

49:001:006 To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made
           us accepted in the beloved.

49:001:007 In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness
           of sins, according to the riches of his grace;

49:001:008 Wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence;

49:001:009 Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according
           to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself:

49:001:010 That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might
           gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in
           heaven, and which are on earth; even in him:

49:001:011 In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being
           predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all
           things after the counsel of his own will:

49:001:012 That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first
           trusted in Christ.

49:001:013 In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of
           truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that
           ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise,

49:001:014 Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption
           of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory.

49:001:015 Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord
           Jesus, and love unto all the saints,

49:001:016 Cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my
           prayers;

49:001:017 That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory,
           may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the
           knowledge of him:

49:001:018 The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may
           know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of
           the glory of his inheritance in the saints,

49:001:019 And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward
           who believe, according to the working of his mighty power,

49:001:020 Which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead,
           and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places,

49:001:021 Far above all principality, and power, and might, and
           dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this
           world, but also in that which is to come:

49:001:022 And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the
           head over all things to the church,

49:001:023 Which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all.

49:002:001 And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and
           sins;

49:002:002 Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this
           world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the
           spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience:

49:002:003 Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in
           the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh
           and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath,
           even as others.

49:002:004 But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he
           loved us,

49:002:005 Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together
           with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;)

49:002:006 And hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in
           heavenly places in Christ Jesus:

49:002:007 That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of
           his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.

49:002:008 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of
           yourselves: it is the gift of God:

49:002:009 Not of works, lest any man should boast.

49:002:010 For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good
           works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in
           them.

49:002:011 Wherefore remember, that ye being in time past Gentiles in the
           flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called
           the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands;

49:002:012 That at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from
           the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants
           of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world:

49:002:013 But now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made
           nigh by the blood of Christ.

49:002:014 For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken
           down the middle wall of partition between us;

49:002:015 Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of
           commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself
           of twain one new man, so making peace;

49:002:016 And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the
           cross, having slain the enmity thereby:

49:002:017 And came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to
           them that were nigh.

49:002:018 For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the
           Father.

49:002:019 Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but
           fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God;

49:002:020 And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and
           prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone;

49:002:021 In whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an
           holy temple in the Lord:

49:002:022 In whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God
           through the Spirit.

49:003:001 For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you
           Gentiles,

49:003:002 If ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which
           is given me to you-ward:

49:003:003 How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery; (as
           I wrote afore in few words,

49:003:004 Whereby, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the
           mystery of Christ)

49:003:005 Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men,
           as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by
           the Spirit;

49:003:006 That the Gentiles should be fellowheirs, and of the same body,
           and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel:

49:003:007 Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the
           grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his
           power.

49:003:008 Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this
           grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the
           unsearchable riches of Christ;

49:003:009 And to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery,
           which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God,
           who created all things by Jesus Christ:

49:003:010 To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in
           heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold
           wisdom of God,

49:003:011 According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ
           Jesus our Lord:

49:003:012 In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the
           faith of him.

49:003:013 Wherefore I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for
           you, which is your glory.

49:003:014 For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord
           Jesus Christ,

49:003:015 Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named,

49:003:016 That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory,
           to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man;

49:003:017 That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being
           rooted and grounded in love,

49:003:018 May be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth,
           and length, and depth, and height;

49:003:019 And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that
           ye might be filled with all the fulness of God.

49:003:020 Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all
           that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in
           us,

49:003:021 Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all
           ages, world without end. Amen.

49:004:001 I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye
           walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called,

49:004:002 With all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering,
           forbearing one another in love;

49:004:003 Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of
           peace.

49:004:004 There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in
           one hope of your calling;

49:004:005 One Lord, one faith, one baptism,

49:004:006 One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all,
           and in you all.

49:004:007 But unto every one of us is given grace according to the
           measure of the gift of Christ.

49:004:008 Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led
           captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men.

49:004:009 (Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended
           first into the lower parts of the earth?

49:004:010 He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above
           all heavens, that he might fill all things.)

49:004:011 And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some,
           evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;

49:004:012 For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the
           ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:

49:004:013 Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the
           knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the
           measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:

49:004:014 That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and
           carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of
           men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to
           deceive;

49:004:015 But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all
           things, which is the head, even Christ:

49:004:016 From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted
           by that which every joint supplieth, according to the
           effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh
           increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love.

49:004:017 This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye
           henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of
           their mind,

49:004:018 Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the
           life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of
           the blindness of their heart:

49:004:019 Who being past feeling have given themselves over unto
           lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness.

49:004:020 But ye have not so learned Christ;

49:004:021 If so be that ye have heard him, and have been taught by him,
           as the truth is in Jesus:

49:004:022 That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old
           man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts;

49:004:023 And be renewed in the spirit of your mind;

49:004:024 And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in
           righteousness and true holiness.

49:004:025 Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his
           neighbour: for we are members one of another.

49:004:026 Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your
           wrath:

49:004:027 Neither give place to the devil.

49:004:028 Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour,
           working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may
           have to give to him that needeth.

49:004:029 Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but
           that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may
           minister grace unto the hearers.

49:004:030 And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed
           unto the day of redemption.

49:004:031 Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and
           evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice:

49:004:032 And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one
           another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you.

49:005:001 Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children;

49:005:002 And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given
           himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a
           sweetsmelling savour.

49:005:003 But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it
           not be once named among you, as becometh saints;

49:005:004 Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which
           are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks.

49:005:005 For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor
           covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the
           kingdom of Christ and of God.

49:005:006 Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these
           things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of
           disobedience.

49:005:007 Be not ye therefore partakers with them.

49:005:008 For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the
           Lord: walk as children of light:

49:005:009 (For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and
           righteousness and truth;)

49:005:010 Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.

49:005:011 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness,
           but rather reprove them.

49:005:012 For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done
           of them in secret.

49:005:013 But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the
           light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light.

49:005:014 Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from
           the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.

49:005:015 See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as
           wise,

49:005:016 Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.

49:005:017 Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of
           the Lord is.

49:005:018 And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled
           with the Spirit;

49:005:019 Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual
           songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;

49:005:020 Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in
           the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;

49:005:021 Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.

49:005:022 Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the
           Lord.

49:005:023 For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the
           head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.

49:005:024 Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the
           wives be to their own husbands in every thing.

49:005:025 Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the
           church, and gave himself for it;

49:005:026 That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of
           water by the word,

49:005:027 That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not
           having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should
           be holy and without blemish.

49:005:028 So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that
           loveth his wife loveth himself.

49:005:029 For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and
           cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church:

49:005:030 For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his
           bones.

49:005:031 For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and
           shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one
           flesh.

49:005:032 This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the
           church.

49:005:033 Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his
           wife even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her
           husband.

49:006:001 Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right.

49:006:002 Honour thy father and mother; which is the first commandment
           with promise;

49:006:003 That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on
           the earth.

49:006:004 And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring
           them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.

49:006:005 Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according
           to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your
           heart, as unto Christ;

49:006:006 Not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the servants of
           Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;

49:006:007 With good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men:

49:006:008 Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same
           shall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free.

49:006:009 And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing
           threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven;
           neither is there respect of persons with him.

49:006:010 Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power
           of his might.

49:006:011 Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand
           against the wiles of the devil.

49:006:012 For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against
           principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the
           darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high
           places.

49:006:013 Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may
           be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to
           stand.

49:006:014 Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and
           having on the breastplate of righteousness;

49:006:015 And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of
           peace;

49:006:016 Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be
           able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.

49:006:017 And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit,
           which is the word of God:

49:006:018 Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit,
           and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication
           for all saints;

49:006:019 And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may
           open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel,

49:006:020 For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may
           speak boldly, as I ought to speak.

49:006:021 But that ye also may know my affairs, and how I do, Tychicus,
           a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall
           make known to you all things:

49:006:022 Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that ye might
           know our affairs, and that he might comfort your hearts.

49:006:023 Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the
           Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

49:006:024 Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in
           sincerity. Amen.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.


START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg”), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg™ License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg™
electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at www.gutenberg.org. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg™ License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
provided that:

    • You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    
    • You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    
    • You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    
    • You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
    

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
