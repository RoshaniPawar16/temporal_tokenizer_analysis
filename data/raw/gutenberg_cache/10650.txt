When the Saints Go Marching In
(Traditional)

I am just a lonesome traveller,
Through this big wide world of sin;
Want to join that grand procession,
When the saints go marchin' in.

Oh when the saints go marchin' in,
Oh when the saints go marchin' in,
Lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marchin' in.

All my folks have gone before me,
All my friends and all my kin;
But I'll meet with them up yonder,
When the saints go marchin' in.

Oh when the saints go marchin' in,
Oh when the saints go marchin' in,
Lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marchin' in.

Come and join me in my journey,
'cause it's time that we begin;
And we'll be there for that judgement,
When the saints go marchin' in.

Oh when the saints go marchin' in,
Oh when the saints go marchin' in,
We will be in line for that judgement,
When the saints go marchin' in.

And when the stars begin to shine
And when the stars begin to shine
Then Lord let me be in that number
And when the stars begin to shine.

When Gabriel blows in his horn
When Gabriel blows in his horn
Then Lord let me be in that number
When Gabriel blows in his horn.

And when the sun refuse to shine
And when the sun refuse to shine
Then Lord let me be in that number
When the sun refuse to shine

And when the moon has turned to blood
And when the moon has turned to blood
Then Lord let me be in that number
When the moon has turned to blood

And when the crown Him King of Kings
And when the crown Him King of Kings
Then Lord let me be in that number
When the crown Him King of Kings
