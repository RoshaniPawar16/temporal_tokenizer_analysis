PREFACE.

Second Series.


The following examples of Knitting--like those in the former
Series--have been selected with the greatest care; adhering to the same
technical terms, and mode of arrangement.

The writer cannot but feel flattered with the reception given to the
_First Series_ of “My Knitting Book,” and also to her other volumes on
Decorative Needlework:--and she deems that their general correctness
and utility are proved by the translations made of them into the
Continental languages, and by their verbatim republication in America.

Since the publication of the first edition of the present series,
the whole of the examples have been carefully reworked, and the
faults of the first impressions have been corrected; yet, it
is not to be wondered at, in a work of this description, that
errors--notwithstanding every precaution--should occasionally creep in.
Hence the writer will be much indebted for corrections of any mistakes
that may be discovered by ladies using these books; she cannot,
however, attend to anonymous communications, or to such as relate to
supposable errors arising from misunderstanding on the part of the
Knitter.

MY KNITTING BOOK.

SECOND SERIES.




Introduction.


It has been justly observed that, “an art cannot be taught but by
its proper terms.” In the art of knitting, various terms have been
employed--whether correctly, or not, it is here needless to inquire--to
designate the same simple process. Confusion has necessarily been
the result. Those who are accustomed to follow the technicalities of
one writer on knitting, are not unfrequently perplexed to comprehend
the directions of another, however clearly and concisely they may be
laid down. Hence, in the _first series_ of the present treatises,
the writer confined herself to the use of the technical terms most
generally employed by adepts in the art, and which appeared to be those
most easy of comprehension. The following directions, therefore, will
be conveyed in the same phraseology; but, for ease of reference, and
for the use of those who may not possess the former series, it has been
deemed expedient to repeat the--




Explanation of Terms used in Knitting.


_To cast on._--To make the first interlacement of the thread on the
needle.

_To cast off._--To knit two stitches, and to pass the first over the
second, and so on, to the last stitch, which is to be secured by
drawing the thread through.

_To pearl._--To knit a stitch with the thread before the needle.

_To narrow._--To lessen, by knitting two stitches together.

_To widen._--To increase by making a stitch, bringing the cotton round
the needle, and knitting the same when it occurs.

_A Turn._--Two rows in the same stitch, backwards and forwards.

_A Row._--The stitches from one end of the needle to the other.

_A Round._--A row, when the stitches are on two, three, or more needles.

_A plain Row._--That composed of simple knitting.

_To pearl a Row._--To knit with the thread before the needle.

_To rib._--To work alternate rows of plain, and pearl, knitting.

_To bring the thread forward._--To _make_ a stitch, by bringing the
thread forward, after a _knitted_ stitch.

_To pass the thread over._--To _make_ a stitch, by passing the thread
over the needle, after a _pearled_ stitch.

_To make a stitch._--If after a _knitted_ stitch, this is done by
bringing the thread forward;--if after a _pearled_ stitch,--by passing
the thread over.--To make a stitch _between two pearled_ stitches,
the thread must be turned round the needle; that is,--passed over the
needle, and brought again in front; but, to make a stitch between a
_pearled_ stitch and a _knitted_ stitch,--the thread must only be
passed over the needle.

_To turn the thread round the needle._--If the thread is before the
needle, to pass it over the needle, and bring it again in front.

_To bring the thread forward twice._--To bring the thread forward, and
then, by turning it round the needle, to bring it forward again.

_To increase._--To make a stitch.

_To decrease._--To knit two stitches, taken together, in one.

_To knit two together._--To knit two stitches, taken together, in one.

_Knitting and pearling in the same row._--When the stitch, next after
a pearled stitch, is to be knitted, it is obvious that the thread
must be passed back _under_ the needle, before this can be done;--in
like manner, when a stitch is to be pearled, after a knitted stitch,
the thread must be brought in front _under_ the needle;--processes,
however, very different from those of _passing the thread over_, and
_bringing the thread forward_, both of which are for the purpose of
_making_ a stitch, and are done _above_ the needle.

_To slip, or pass a stitch._--To change it from one needle to the
other, _without_ knitting it.

_To fasten on._--The best way to fasten on, is to place the two ends
contrariwise, and knit a few stitches with both together: but, when
knitting with silk, or fine cotton, a _weaver’s_ knot will be found the
best.

_A Loop Stitch._--Made by bringing the thread before the needle, which,
in knitting the succeeding stitch, will again take its own place.

_Pearl, seam, and rib-stitch._--All signify the same.

It appears almost unnecessary to observe that, in some of the
directions, in order to avoid repetition, the following mode of
abbreviation has been adopted.--When a part of a row, or round, only is
to be repeated, it is separated from the preceding part, by a letter
of the alphabet, inserted in smaller type, between two brackets;
thus,--repeat from (a) signifies that the part placed next after (a)
alone is to be repeated. Further, to prevent confusion, when it was
necessary to employ such an abbreviation more than once in the same
directions, the other letters of the alphabet, in a similar manner,
have been taken in their order of succession.

N.B. The _sizes_ of the _needles_ are given according to the _Standard
Filière_.

It is necessary, in giving or following directions for knitting, to
caution knitters to observe a medium in their work--not knitting either
too loosely or too tightly.




[Illustration: [THE STANDARD FILIÈRE.]]

The above engraving represents the _Standard Filière_, or knitting
and netting needle guage, an instrument invented some time since by
Miss Lambert, and now in general use, by which the different sizes
of knitting and netting needles can be ascertained with the greatest
accuracy.




Cable Plait Stitch for a Quilt.


This forms a very warm quilt. It may be made in stripes or bands, of
about seven inches in width, each band containing four repetitions of
the pattern.--Three needles, No. 1, will be required, one of which must
be pointed at either end.

Cast on forty-two stitches with nine-thread fleecy.

_First row_--knit two;(a) pearl six; knit four.--Repeat from (a).

_Second row_--pearl four;(b) pass three stitches on to the
double-pointed needle; knit the next three stitches; knit the three
stitches that were passed on to the third needle; pearl four.--Repeat
from (b).

_Third row_--knit two;(c) pearl six; knit four.--Repeat from (c).

_Fourth row_--pearl four;(d) knit six; pearl four.--Repeat from (d).

_Fifth row_--knit two;(e) pearl six; knit four.--Repeat from (e).

_Sixth row_--pearl four;(f) knit six; pearl four.--Repeat from (f).

_Seventh row_--knit two;(g) pearl six; knit four.--Repeat from (g).

Commence again, as at second row.




Centre for a Quilt, or Bassinet Cover.


This may be knitted with two colours--say white and shaded
pink.--Needles, No. 7.--Cast on any even number of stitches with
eight-thread Zephyr fleecy.

N.B. The first and last stitches of every row are to be knitted plain.
The colour should be changed in every fourth, or pearled, row.

_First row_--knit two together.

_Second row_--make one between each stitch, by taking up the wool
between the stitches of the preceding row, except between the two last
stitches.

_Third row_--plain knitting.

_Fourth row_--pearl knitting.

Commence again, as at first row.




Border for a Quilt, or Bassinet Cover.


This forms a very pretty border for the preceding centre pattern; the
corners are so arranged that they can be joined correctly, when worked
in four pieces of the requisite length.--Zephyr fleecy.--Needles, No. 7.

The same colours as the centre may be used. Cast on any number of
stitches that can be divided by nine, and one over--white.

N.B. At the end of each pattern row,--bring the wool forward, knit one;
bring the wool forward; then, finish the same (_reversed_) as at the
commencement.

_First row_--plain knitting.

_Second row_--coloured,--knit three together; knit six;(a) bring the
wool forward, knit one; bring the wool forward, knit two; knit two
together, twice; knit two.--Repeat from (a).

_Third row_--pearl knitting.

_Fourth row_--knit three together; knit five;(b) bring the wool
forward, knit one; bring the wool forward, knit two; knit two together,
twice; knit two.--Repeat from (b).

_Fifth row_--pearl knitting.

_Sixth row_--knit three together; knit four;(c) bring the wool forward,
knit one; bring the wool forward, knit two; knit two together, twice;
knit two.--Repeat from (c).

_Seventh row_--pearl knitting,}
                              }
_Eighth row_--pearl knitting, } white.
                              }
_Ninth row_--plain knitting,  }

_Tenth row_--plain knitting,--coloured.

_Eleventh row_--pearl three together; pearl three;(d) turn the wool
round the needle, pearl one; turn the wool round the needle, pearl
two; pearl two together, twice; pearl two.--Repeat from (d).

_Twelfth row_--plain knitting.

_Thirteenth row_--pearl three together; pearl two;(e) turn the wool
round the needle, pearl one; turn the wool round the needle, pearl two;
pearl two together, twice; pearl two.--Repeat from (e).

_Fourteenth row_--plain knitting.

_Fifteenth row_--pearl knitting,  }
                                  }
_Sixteenth row_--pearl knitting,  } white.
                                  }
_Seventeenth row_--plain knitting,}




A Quilt in Raised Stripes.


Cast on any number of stitches that can be divided by three.
--Eight-thread fleecy, two colours--say pink and white.--Needles, No.
1, pointed at both ends.

_First row_--with pink,--bring the wool forward, slip one; knit two
together.--Repeat.

_Second row_--with white,--same as first.

_Third row_--with pink,--commence from the other end of the
needle, pearl two together; slip one; turn the wool round the
needle.--Repeat.--_Finish_ with--turn the wool round the needle, pearl
one.

_Fourth row_--with white,--same as third.

Commence again, as at first row.




A Baby’s Quilt in Stripes of alternate Colours.


This is worked in separate stripes, and afterwards sewn together by the
loops formed on either side of the pattern. About nine stripes, each
twenty-seven inches long, will be required. It is prettiest in pink and
white, or pale blue and white.

Cast on twelve stitches for each stripe.--Six-thread fleecy.--Short
needles, No. 8.

_First row_--bring the wool forward, knit two together; knit
two.--Repeat.

Every row is the same.




Another Quilt.


This pattern may be worked in pink, and white, nine-thread
fleecy.--Needles No. 2.--Cast on any number of stitches that can be
divided by three.

_First row_--with white,--bring the wool forward, slip one; knit two,
pass the slip-stitch over them.--Repeat.

_Second row_--with pink,--pearl knitting.

_Third row_--the same as the first, with pink.

It is not necessary to break off the wool, as it may be passed from row
to row. The colour is always to be changed in the pearled row.




A Carriage Sock.


This sock is intended to be drawn over the shoe; it will be found very
elastic, warm, and comfortable, fitting close both to the foot and
ankle.

Four needles, No. 23.--German wool,--two colours may be used,--say
scarlet and black.--Cast on loosely one hundred and forty stitches,
viz.--fifty on each of two needles, and forty on the third.

Knit twenty-five rounds with _black_,--two stitches, alternately, pearl
and plain.

Knit twenty-three similar rounds with _scarlet_.

Knit twenty-three similar rounds with _black_.

Knit thirty-four similar rounds, commencing with _scarlet_; but
decreasing on each round,--by pearling two; and knitting two together,
taken at the back, at the commencement of each round; and knitting the
last two stitches together, in the front;--when seventy-two stitches
only will remain on the needles.

Knit fifty rounds, as at the commencement.

N.B. Every twenty-three rounds should be alternately black and scarlet;
hence the sock will be formed of three stripes of black, and three of
scarlet, of an equal width, finished at the top with a half stripe of
black. The widest part, which forms the bottom or foot of the sock,
should be sewn, or loosely knitted, up. A leathern sole, if desired,
may afterwards be attached. This sock, although when in the hand it
does not exhibit much form, when drawn over the foot will be found to
fit exactly to its shape.

_Remarks._--The above directions are for a full-sized lady’s sock. If
larger needles and coarser wool be employed, the knitting will be still
more elastic, and a fewer number of stitches will be required. The
same directions, with a change of material, are equally adapted for a
large loose night, or bath, sock. With a fewer number of stitches, but
observing the same relative proportions throughout, most comfortable
and warm leggings, for drawing over infants’ shoes, may be made, which
are not apt either to roll over, or slip off.




A Travelling Cap.


This cap may be knitted with double German wool, in five shades of any
light colour, and white.--Needles, No. 8.

Cast on one hundred and two stitches, with the darkest shade of
colour.--Knit one plain row to form an edge. Then, commence the pattern
(formed of four rows) as follows.

N.B. The first stitch of each row is always to be knitted.

_First row_--knit two together.

_Second row_--make one between each stitch, by taking up the wool
between the stitches of the preceding row;--except between the two last
stitches.

_Third row_--plain knitting.

_Fourth row_--pearl knitting.--The change of shade is always to be made
in this row.

Repeat the above, four times, taking a lighter shade of wool for
each pattern. Then work _one pattern_ in _white_,--and repeat the
five coloured patterns, reversing the shades, by commencing with the
lightest. The fourth row of the eleventh pattern is to be omitted, in
place of which one row must be pearled in _white_,--in order to bring
the knitting on the outer side of the cap.

The front, or roll part, is now completed, which, when the cap is
finished, should be turned over from the centre pattern of white.

Knit _one pattern_ in _white_, leaving twenty stitches unknit, at the
end of the fourth row.--Knit a _second pattern_, the same, leaving
twenty stitches unknit, at the end of the first row; and, in the
succeeding rows, making a stitch between the last two stitches; also,
at the end of the second row, leaving twenty-two stitches unknit; and,
at the ends of the third, and fourth, rows, leaving twenty-six stitches
unknit.

Knit a _third pattern_ in _white_, leaving twenty-six stitches unknit
at the end of the first three rows; but, in the fourth row, pearl all
the stitches to the end of the needle.

Knit a _fourth pattern_ in _white_;--in the first row of this, knit all
the stitches to the other end of the needle; but, at the end of the
third row, leave twenty stitches unknit. Pearl the fourth row, with the
third shade of the coloured wool, leaving twenty stitches unknit, at
the end.

Knit _three_ more _patterns_ in _colours_,--(the centre being darker
than the other two) leaving one stitch more unknit, at the end of each
row. The fourth row of the third pattern is to be pearled in white.

Knit _seven patterns_ in _white_, leaving one stitch unknit at the end
of each row; and also, omitting to make a stitch between the first two,
and last two, stitches of the second row.

When the seventh pattern is completed, there should be only eight
stitches on the needle: with these eight, knit _one pattern_; and, at
the end of the pearled row, pass the last stitch, before knitting, on
to the other needle; then knit it, together with two of those before
left unknit,--three in one.

Proceed in the like manner, at the end of the next, or double stitch
row, and continue the same, until _seven patterns_ are finished, from
the above eight stitches.

Before commencing the last pearled row, fasten on the third shade of
coloured wool, and pearl to the end of the row. Then, knit the last
stitch, together with three of the unknit stitches,--four in one.
Repeat the same, at the end of the next row.

In the next pearled row, knit again four together, as above, and three
single stitches beyond, at the end of the double stitch row: also, knit
four together, and one single, and two double beyond.

When two patterns, in the third shade, are completed, fasten on the
white wool, and pearl a row;--at the end of this, knit three single
stitches of the unknit beyond. In the next row,--knit, alternately,
a double and a single stitch, throughout the row;--knitting the last
stitch, together with one row of the unknit, and two single ones beyond.

In the next row, make a stitch between each, as usual; and, at the end
of the next pearled row, knit three single stitches beyond. Work the
three next rows as follows:

_First_--three double, and one single stitch, alternately:--the last
must be a double stitch, and a single stitch beyond.

_Second_--a stitch between each, and three single stitches beyond.

_Third_--plain knitting, and three single stitches beyond.

Before commencing the next pearled row, fasten on the darkest coloured
wool; knit a pattern quite to the end of each needle, and fasten
off,--omitting the pearled row.

The cord for tieing this cap may be made by plaiting one
light-coloured, and two dark-coloured, threads of wool together; each
thread consisting of four plies of German wool. One cord passes across
the front of the cap, under the chin, and another round the caul,
with a bow at the side: the ends finishing with a tassel of white
wool.--Ribands, which are prettier, may be substituted.

A Shawl in Raised Knitting.


The centre may be worked in violet, or dark claret: the border in
eight shades of stone colour, including the extreme shades--black and
white.--German wool.--Two needles, No. 16, and one needle, No. 10.

Commence with the border, by casting on four hundred and eighty
stitches, with black. Work two _patterns_ in each shade of colour,
decreasing, by knitting two together, at the beginning of each _row_,
except on the first four;--when four hundred and twenty stitches will
remain on the needle for the centre of the shawl.

With the violet or claret wool, work a _square_ of four hundred and
twenty stitches, to form the centre. Then,--

Commence the opposite border, with the white shade of stone colour,
increasing on every row, except on the last four; and reversing the
shades of colour, so as to form a similar border to the first.

Two side borders, in separate pieces, are now to be worked in the
manner first described. These are afterwards to be sewn on;--the
decreasing having formed an angle, that admits of the right shades of
colour joining correctly.

are worked as follows;--

_First row_--with small needle,--bring the wool forward, knit two
together.--Repeat.

rounds, will now be finished, when thirty-one stitches should remain on
the needles.

Knit twelve rounds, pearling two, and knitting two, alternately, except
under the spout, where one stitch only is to be knitted. Then,--

With the _blue_ wool, commence forming the bowl of the jug; increasing,

Seventy-two stitches should now remain on the needles. Divide this
number of stitches by six, and knit eleven rounds with _orange_;
decreasing six stitches in each round, by knitting two together, at
the commencement of each division; when a star of six points will be
formed, and six stitches only will remain on the needles:--these are to
be drawn up at the point.

Take up eight stitches on the side opposite the spout; then, in
pearled, and plain rows, work a piece about an inch and a half
long--with _orange_. The end of this is to be attached to the first row
of the bowl of the jug, to form the handle.




An Easy Stitch for various Purposes.


This is an easy and light stitch. It may be worked with fine or coarse
wool, for half handkerchiefs, bonnet caps, under spencers, sleeves,
etc. For most useful purposes, three-thread fleecy, and needles No. 12,
may be employed.

Cast on any number of stitches that can be divided by three.

_First row_--bring the wool forward, knit two together; knit
one.--Repeat.

_Second row_--plain knitting.

Repeat these two rows, alternately.

When knitting sleeves, or any other article, where decreasing is
necessary, knit two together, at the beginning of every second row.




A Chancelière.


Six-thread fleecy, say two colours, blue and drab.--Needles, No. 14.

Cast on forty-two stitches, and knit six, or eight, _patterns_, (see
directions next page), alternately drab and blue, until a piece about
twenty-four inches in length be worked. Then--with one colour--knit, in
a similar manner, a band about thirty inches in length, and three or
four inches wide, to form the sides.

In brioche stitch, work two corresponding pieces, with white, to form
the lining. These four pieces are to be wadded, and mounted, in the
usual form. The opening for the feet should be edged with a worsted
ermine trimming.

The _pattern_ is knitted as follows;--

Cast on any number of stitches that can be divided by three.

_First row_--bring the wool forward, slip one; knit two
together.--Repeat.

_Second row_--knit two; slip the long stitch.--Repeat.

_Third row_--knit two together;(a) bring the wool forward, slip one;
knit two together.--Repeat from (a).--_Finish_ with--bring the wool

(b).

Commence again, as at first row.




A Warm Half-square Shawl.


German wool--used double.--Needles, No. 6.--Scarlet, and four shades
of bright green slate colour, form a pretty contrast. The shawl should
be worked in alternate stripes of the two colours; each stripe being
composed of four patterns,--that is, one pattern in each shade of the
green slate colour, and four patterns in scarlet.

Cast on two hundred and forty stitches with the lightest shade of
_slate_ colour.

_First row_--bring the wool forward, slip one; knit two, pass the
slip-stitch over them.--Repeat to the end of the row, except on the two
last stitches, which are to be knitted together.

_Second row_--pearl knitting.

Repeat these two rows, with the three other shades of slate
colour,--decreasing (by knitting two together) at the end of every
pattern row.

With the _scarlet_ wool, knit four patterns, in a similar manner.

Two stripes, of an equal width, will thus be formed;--the one, composed
of four shades of slate colour, and the other, of scarlet. These are to
be repeated, alternately, until the half square be finished.

A fringe for this shawl may be knitted with scarlet, as follows.




Fringe for a Shawl.


This forms a very pretty fringe for the preceding shawl pattern.

Cast on twelve stitches with scarlet German wool--used double.
--Needles, No. 6.

_First row_--bring the wool forward, knit two together.--Repeat.

Every row is the same. When finished, cast off three patterns; and
unravel the remainder for the fringe.

Before unravelling, the knitting should be thoroughly damped, and
afterwards dried before a fire. This will cause the wool to curl,
and form a better fringe. Each loop should be knotted, close to the
knitting.

It is advisable to knit this fringe in one length. It may be easily
made to sit well round the point of the shawl, by fulling it a little,
in the sewing on.




THE TWELVE FOLLOWING PATTERNS ARE INTENDED FOR A SET OF D’OYLEYS.--THEY
  ARE TO BE WORKED WITH KNITTING COTTON, NO. 20, AND NEEDLES, NO.
  26. WHEN WORKED WITH COARSER COTTON, AND LARGER NEEDLES, THE OPEN
  PATTERNS FORM TIDIES; AND THE CLOSE PATTERNS (OF THE SIZE DIRECTED),
  MAKE PRETTY COVERS FOR TOILET CUSHIONS, ETC.


D’Oyleys.


These D’Oyleys, as nearly as the patterns will allow, work about six
inches square; they have an open border, with a plain edge of three
stitches, on each side. Some of the centres are arranged to contain
a certain number of _perfect_ patterns; but others, where such an
arrangement would have interfered with the symmetry of the borders,
are curtailed of a few stitches:--thus, No. IV. contains four
perfect patterns, each composed of fifteen stitches; and one pattern
of thirteen stitches only--the open part of the pattern, on one side,
being omitted.

In addition to the borders above mentioned, these D’Oyleys should be
trimmed with a netted scalloped edging, or, with one of the knitted
edgings to be found in this book: a coarse lace, however, if preferred,
will equally answer the purpose.

As the first twelve rows--composing the border--of each D’Oyley, are
the same, the repetition of them, in each pattern, appears useless; the
following directions, therefore, will serve for the commencement of
all, and form--




A Border for each D’Oyley.


Knit _six_ plain _rows_.

_Seventh row_--knit three; bring the thread forward, knit two
together.--Repeat, except on the last three stitches, which knit plain.

_Eighth row_--pearl knitting, except on the first three, and last
three, stitches, which are to be knitted plain.

Repeat the seventh, and eighth, rows, making altogether, twelve rows
from the commencement.

The above forms the upper border of the D’Oyley. The side borders
are included in the directions given for each row of the centre
patterns.--The lower border--worked the same (reversed) as the
upper--it appears unnecessary to repeat.

N.B. The pattern of the centre is always commenced on the _thirteenth_
row of each D’Oyley.

A Warm Habit Shirt.


A warm habit-shirt, for wearing either over, or under, the dress, may
be made with three-thread fleecy.--Needles, No. 12.

The border should be worked in a different colour to that of the other
part.

Cast on thirty-six stitches,--with the border colour. Knit twelve plain
rows.

This completes the border at the waist. In the next row--knit
eight,--with the first colour,--for the border at the side; then,--with
the other colour,--knit four, pearl four, alternately, for the next
twenty stitches; knit eight,--with the first colour,--for the border on
the other side. Knit three more rows, in a similar manner,--observing
to make a stitch, between the border and the pattern, at the
commencement of every row.

Work four similar rows, but alternating the stitches, by pearling on
the knitted stitches, and knitting on the pearled stitches, of the
previous four rows,--so as to form a checked pattern.

Repeat the last eight rows, alternately four and four, until twenty
patterns in height be worked; when twenty-five patterns in width should
count on the needle.

Pass forty stitches from one side, on to another needle; leaving (when
the same number shall have been passed off from the other side), nine
patterns, or thirty-six stitches, for the back of the shirt.

Knit, on the forty stitches, one of the two pieces, that pass over the
shoulders and form the front of the shirt, as follows.

N.B. The border (of eight stitches) is continued on the _outer_ side at
the same time. The borders, at the top of the back, and of the _inner_
sides of the front pieces, are knitted afterwards.

Knit four patterns, increasing on one side only--between the pattern
and outer border.

Knit four patterns, increasing, as before, on the outer side, between
the pattern and the border; and plain knitting four stitches on the
_inner_ side of every row.

N.B. The four plain stitches on the _inner_ side of the row are now to
be repeated on every succeeding row.

Work a sufficient number of rows to complete this portion of the front
of the shirt; decreasing on every row, between the pattern and the
four plain stitches, on the _inner_ side. Between the border and the
pattern, on the _outer_ side, bring the wool forward, and knit two

A Polka Riding, or Yacht, Jacket.


These coats are made with sleeves and collar; they descend about twelve
inches below the waist, and form very comfortable warm wrappers,
fitting tight to the figure. They should be knitted in a dark rich
colour, with a border, about four inches deep, in black or white. If
the border be white, small black worsted tufts, in imitation of ermine,
may be added. According to the following improved method of working
this jacket, it is divided into three portions,--the body, the sleeves,
and the collar.

N.B. The whole of the knitting is in _Brioche_ stitch; that is,--bring
the wool forward, slip one, knit two together.

knitting to the shoulder.

In the next _ten_ rows, leave two ribs unknit, at the beginning of the
first two rows;--two more, at the second two rows;--two more, at the
third two rows;--two more, at the fourth two rows;--and two more at the

form the shoulder and arm holes.

the stitches on the needle--and cast off.

rows. Sew the cuff to the narrow end of the sleeve. Then, sew up the

OPINIONS OF THE PRESS.

“A fourth edition of a book, that every buyer puts to the test by
proving its utility and efficiency, is the best kind of praise; and
leaves for us only to record the facts, that this new edition is
improved as well as amplified, and at the same time reduced in price
without being less handsome than before.”--SPECTATOR.

character, especially for the distinctness and precision of their
directions.”--ENGLISH CHURCHMAN.

At the top of page 45 “repeat from (e)” has been changed to “repeat

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
