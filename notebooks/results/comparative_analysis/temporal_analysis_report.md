## Conclusion

This analysis provides insights into the temporal distribution of training data for various language models by examining their tokenizer patterns. The findings suggest significant variations in how different models represent content from different time periods, which may affect their performance on tasks requiring knowledge of specific eras.

**Limitations:** The analysis is based on synthetic data and limited samples. Results should be interpreted as relative trends rather than exact proportions. Additional data and validation would strengthen these conclusions.
